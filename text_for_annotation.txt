Comprehensive Review Infection in Organ Transplantation J. A. Fishman* Transplant Infectious Disease and Immunocompromised Host Program and MGH Transplant Center,Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA *Corresponding author: Jay A. Fishman,jﬁshman@mgh.harvard.edu The prevention, diagnosis, and management of infec- tious disease in transplantation are major contribu- tors to improved outcomes in organ transplantation.The risk of serious infections in organ recipients is determined by interactions between the patient’s epidemiological exposures and net state of immunesuppression. In organ recipients, there is a signiﬁcantincidence of drug toxicity and a propensity for drug interactions with immunosuppressive agents used to maintain graft function. Thus, every effort must bemade to establish speciﬁc microbiologic diagnosesto optimize therapy. A timeline can be created to develop a differential diagnosis of infection in trans- plantation based on common patterns of infectiousexposures, immunosuppressive management, and antimicrobial prophylaxis. Application of quantitative molecular microbial assays and advanced antimicro-bial therapies have advanced care. Pathogen-speciﬁcimmunity, genetic polymorphisms in immune responses, and dynamic interactions between the microbiome and the risk of infection are beginningto be explored. The role of infection in the stimula-tion of alloimmune responses awaits further deﬁni- tion. Major hurdles include the shifting worldwide epidemiology of infections, increasing antimicrobialresistance, suboptimal assays for the microbiologicscreening of organ donors, and virus-associated malignancies. Transplant infectious disease remains a key to the clinical and scientiﬁc investigation oforgan transplantation.

The emergence of Transplant Infectious Disease as a specialty has paralleled the expansion of organ transplan- tation with prolonged allograft and patient survivals andincreasingly effective immunosuppressive agents. Recentadvances include the availability of international standards for quantitative molecular assays for common viruses, demonstration of links between genetic polymorphisms inimmune responses with the risk for speciﬁc infections, and newer antimicrobial therapies including those for hep- atitis C virus (HCV) as well as the development of somedetailed practice guidelines (1 –4). Challenges include the paucity of assays to assess risk for speciﬁc infections or graft rejection, increasing antimicrobial resistance, subop-timal screening paradigms for microbiologic evaluation of organ donors, virus-associated malignancies, and shifts in global patterns of infection (e.g. Zika and West Nile [WNV]viruses). Bedside clinical skills remain paramount inimmunocompromised hosts who manifest few clinical signs of infection. This review will describe an approach to the management of infection in transplantation. General concepts A wide spectrum of potential pathogens infects immuno-compromised hosts; many are infrequent pathogens in normal individuals. Fever and physical signs of infection (e.g. erythema) are diminished; infection may be signaledby more subtle laboratory (e.g. liver function tests) or radiographic abnormalities. Antimetabolites (azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil) are associated with lowerleukocyte counts and lower maximum temperatures. Sig- niﬁcant infections such as peritonitis may lack fever or localizing signs. Up to 40% of infections cause no fever,notably in fungal infections, and up to 22% of fevers are noninfectious in origin (5,6). Given hepatic metabolism and renal toxicity of calcineurin inhibitors, drug interactions and renal injuries are com- mon. Thus, every effort must be made to establish 856©2017 The American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons doi: 10.1111/ajt.14208American Journal of Transplantation 2017; 17: 856–879 Wiley Periodicals Inc.
speciﬁc microbiologic diagnoses to optimize the therapy for infection while minimizing antimicrobial resistance and associated toxicities . This may necessitate invasive procedures to obtain samples for histopathology, cellcounts, and cultures. Reduction in immunosuppression may be a useful component of antimicrobial therapy but risks graft rejection and increased inﬂammation in theform of immune reconstitution syndromes (7). Pathogen-speciﬁc immune assays suggest the relative risk of cer- tain infections; however, in the face of intensive immunosuppression, protective immunity, while useful,tends to dissipate.Risk of Infection and the Timeline of Infection The risk of infection for the recipient at any point in time after transplantation is a function of two factors: 1 The epidemiologic exposures of the patient and the organ donor including recent, nosocomial, and remote exposures (Table 1) (8). 2 The patient’s “ net state of immunosuppression ” including all factors contributing to the risk of infection (Table 2).

Increased degrees of immune dysfunction predispose to infection at lower microbial inoculums or with less viru-lent organisms or to infections of greater than expectedseverity. With lower levels of immunosuppression, the incidence of infection is less and drug side-effects less frequent, but graft rejection is more common. Immuno-suppression for transplantation impacts all limbs of innate and adaptive immunity; speciﬁc immune defects tend to favor speciﬁc types of infection, e.g. T-lympho-cyte depletion predisposes to viral infections, B cell depletion to encapsulated bacteria, and corticosteroids to Pneumocystis and other fungi (Table 3). Antimicrobial prophylaxis should reﬂect the risk of speciﬁc infections for each immunosuppressive regimen over time. Trans- plantation requires adjustment of preventative strategiesconsidering local immunosuppressive regimens, technicalapproaches, and understanding of local patterns of infec- tion, factors that can be adapted to the management of individual recipients. Epidemiologic exposures and the microbiome The microbiome: Microorganisms in tissues and on barrier surfaces are collectively termed the “microbiome” including both commensal ﬂora and acute exposures (infection). The microbiome of the transplant recipient isderived from multiple sources: prior colonization of mucosal surfaces, latent (viral, parasitic, fungal) infections, infection from the organ donor, and newcommunity-derived or nosocomial exposures. Recent data suggest that these microbes have a dynamic and well- regulated interaction with the normal immune system butmay contribute to immune dysregulation and graft rejection in the transplant recipient (9). The impact of the microbiome on immune function is under investigationbut depends on the context in which microbial shiftsoccur: during immune development; with acute infections; or during homeostatic repopulation afterlymphocyte depletion. In transplant recipients, microbial networks are disrupted by immunosuppression, infectiousexposures, antimicrobial therapies, metabolic disarray,and surgery (Figure 1). Changes in microbial diversity (types, distribution, and concentrations of organisms) and new exposures alter local and systemic immunity andmay affect graft outcomes (9). Viruses (termed the “virome”) have diverse effects on immune function including allograft injury (e.g. inﬂammation, priming ofadaptive responses, altered antigen expression) and predisposition to opportunistic infections —loosely termed “indirect effects” (10). The resiliency of the “normal”host microbiome (“microbiome homeostasis”) may promote more tolerant immune responses. Infectious exposures may promote rejection, block tolerance, orstimulate cross-reactive cellular alloimmunity. Memory Tcell responses to previously encountered pathogens that cross-react with alloantigens constitute “heterologous immunity,” the clinical signiﬁcance of which requiresclariﬁcation (11,12). Further study is needed of the interactions between the microbiome and immunity in allograft recipients. Donor- and recipient-derived infections: Donor and recipient microbiologic screening provide essentialdata for development of posttransplant preventative strategies (Tables 4 and 5) (13 –15). These strategies are individualized to include interventions includingtreatment of recipients with isoniazid for latent tuberculosis or ivermectin for Strongyloides stercoralis , vaccination of seronegative recipients, or empiricantifungal therapy in lung recipients. Antiviral strategies for the herpesviruses are based on an assessment of risk of infection based on donor and recipient pathogen-speciﬁcserologies and, increasingly, cellular immune assays(16,17).Table 2: Factors contributing to the “net state of immunosup- pression” /C15Immunosuppressive Therapy: Type, Temporal Sequence, and Intensity /C15Prior therapies (Chemotherapy or Antimicrobials) /C15Mucocutaneous Barrier Integrity (catheters, lines, drains) /C15Neutropenia, Lymphopenia, Hypogammaglobulinemia (often drug-induced) /C15Technical complications (graft injury, ﬂuid collections, wounds) /C15Underlying immune defects (e.g. Genetic polymorphisms, autoimmune disease) /C15Metabolic conditions: uremia, malnutrition, diabetes, alcoholism/cirrhosis, advanced age /C15Viral infection (e.g., herpesviruses, hepatitis B and C, HIV, RSV, inﬂuenza) HIV, human immunodeﬁciency virus; RSV, respiratory syncytial virus.Table 3: Common associations of immunosuppression and infectious syndromes Antilymphocyte globulins (lytic depletion) T-lymphocytes: Activation of latent viruses, fever, cytokines B-lymphocytes: encapsulated bacteria Plasmapheresis: Encapsulated bacteria, line infectionsCo-stimulatory blockade: Unknown; possible increased risk for EBV/PTLD Corticosteroids: Bacteria, fungi (PCP), hepatitis B, wound healing Azathioprine: Neutropenia, possibly papillomavirusMycophenolate mofetil: Early bacterial infection, B-cells, late CMV Calcineurin inhibitors: enhanced herpesviral replication, gingival infection, intracellular pathogens mTOR inhibitors: Poor wound healing, excess infections in combination with other agents, idiosyncratic interstitial pneumonitis EBV, Epstein-Barr virus; PTLD, posttransplant lymphoprolifera- tive disorder; PCP, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia; CMV, cytomegalovirus. 858 American Journal of Transplantation 2017; 17: 856–879Fishman  16006143, 2017, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajt.14208 by Cochrane Germany, Wiley Online Library on [07/12/2023].

Some donor-derived infections (e.g. Strongyloides sterco- ralis, tuberculosis, or coccidioidomycosis) may emerge decades after initial exposure. Donor colonization (e.g.Aspergillus in donor lungs) may also increase susceptibility to graft injury, rejection, vascular or tracheal anastomotic defects, or drug (e.g. m-TOR inhibitor) toxicity. Epidemio-logic history and microbiologic assays are applied to screening of organ donors for common pathogens. Active infections are best treated prior to transplantation. Periop-erative prophylaxis may be adapted for unusual colonizing organisms including multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) or molds; this may be continued postoperativelyin select situations ( Aspergillus colonization in lung recipi- ents) (24). Immunosuppressed patients with incompletely treated infections often relapse. Prolonged prophylaxisrisks emergence of antimicrobial resistance. Universal prophylaxis involves giving preventative therapy to all “at-risk” patients posttransplant for a deﬁned timeperiod; e.g. trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) forPneumocystis and urinary prophylaxis. Pre-emptive therapy employs monitoring of patients at predeﬁned intervals using a sensitive assay (e.g. nucleic acid assays for cytomegalovirus [CMV] or BK polyomavirus) to detect early, active infection. Positive assays result in therapyinitiation. Pre-emptive therapy incurs extra costs for mon-itoring and coordination of outpatient care while reducingthe cost of drugs and the inherent toxicities of drug exposure (25 –28). Unexpected donor-derived infections occur in less than 1% of grafts and may manifest as a cluster of infections among recipients of organs from a common donor(15,29 –31). Uncommon pathogens (e.g. rabies or lympho- cytic choriomeningitis virus) may not be considered or testing may be restricted to specialty laboratories; suchassays are generally of low yield, too costly, and too slow for routine use (30,32). Certain pathogens such as WNV, Dengue, or Trypanosoma cruzi vary with geogra- phy or season; donor screening must be adapted to localrequirements. Testing using highly sensitive assays in low-yield situations risks false-positive assays and unnec- essary organ donor exclusion. Recent guidelines fordonor screening have focused on identiﬁcation of high- risk behaviors for common viruses (human immunodeﬁ- ciency virus [HIV], HCV, hepatitis B virus [HBV]) using acombination of serologic and nucleic acid testing (NAT) (33). NAT screening reduces, but does not eliminate (“residual risk”) the window period following infection inwhich an infected individual has a negative screening result using serologic assays (Table 5) (19 –22). In early infection, donors may have viral loads below the limits ofdetection and lack seroconversion; unexpected viraltransmission to recipients from deceased or living donorsIMMUNOSUPPRESSION SURGERY/ISCHEMIA ANTIMICROBIAL  PROPHYLAXIS AND THERAPY“NORMAL”  MICROBIOME MICROBIOME: RESILIENCE or  REPOPULATIONMICROBIAL DYSBIOSIS ALTERED SYSTEMIC  IMMUNE FUNCTION GRAFT TOLERANCE,  IMPROVED GRAFT FUNCTIONGRAFT REJECTION,  INFLAMMATION, INFECTION,  ISCHEMIA-REPERFUSION  INJURYINFECTION RESTORED  MICROBIOME Figure 1: Transplantation and the microbiome. Transplantation disrupts the composition of commensal microbial ﬂora through a variety of mechanisms, including surgery, diet, immunosuppression, antimicrobial prophylaxis and therapies, infection, and vaccination. Microbial disruption of the host’s baseline microbiome (“Normal”) or “dysbiosis” has been associated with the development of chronic rejection, injury from ischemia –reperfusion injury, and infection (9). Conversely, the resilience of the microbiome or restoration of the diversity of the pretransplant ﬂora (“Restored Microbiome”) has been associated with improved allograft outcomes. The role ofmicrobial manipulation (e.g. by fecal transplantation) as a therapeutic measure to improve allograft outcomes is unclear.

has occurred. Conversely, such testing has allowed the use of “U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) increased risk for transmission of infection” donors such as those dying of drug overdoses who represent up to 40% of thepotential donor pool in some regions. The use of HIV + organs for HIV +recipients (kidney and liver) is increasing(under research protocols in the United States) and requires expertise in antiviral management (34). With effective antiviral therapies, HCV +donor organs are increasingly used for both HCV +and HCV-negative recipi- ents. Community exposures: Travel, hobbies, young children, and work environments provide exposures to contaminatedfood and water ( Listeria, Cryptosporidium ), soil ( Aspergillus orNocardia ), birds ( Cryptococcus ), and geographically restricted mycoses ( Blastomyces dermatitidis ,Coccidioides immitis ,Paracoccidioides species, and Histoplasma capsulatum ) in addition to outbreaks of respiratory viruses and arthropod-borne diseases. Nosocomial exposures: Colonization with antimicrobial- resistant organisms may result from prolonged hospitalizations of organ donors and transplant candidates.The mortality associated with MD RO infections in transplant recipients is increased, likely as a result of delayed recognition and therapy (24,35,36). Common postsurgical infections include vancomyci n-resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant staphylococci, Clostridium difﬁcile colitis, and ﬂuconazole-resistant Candida species. MDROs include carbapenem-resistant enteric gram-negative bacteria, oftenKlebsiella species. Respiratory viral infections may be acquired from medical staff. Increasingly, candidates for transplantation have multiple comorbidities that may requireadvanced cardiopulmonary supports (ventricular assist devices, extracorporeal circulation membrane oxygenation, hemodialysis), prolonged intubation, antimicrobials orimmunosuppressive therapies, and are at increased risk forcolonization by MDRO.Table 4: Microbiologic screening assays for potential organ recipients Medical and family history (countries of origin, habitation, travel, endemic exposures, tuberculosis, dietary habits, water source) Occupational exposures (health care worker, animal contacts, environmental) Hobbies (caves, pigeons, garden, travel), pets, drugs (inhaled or injected) Sexual historyReview microbiological data, vaccinations (BCG vaccine or therapy).

Nucleic acid testing (NAT) measures viral nucleic acids, often using signal ampliﬁcation techniques. Depending onthe performance characteristics of the assay and the amount ofvirus present in the clinical specimen, NAT tends to detect infec- tion earlier and with greater sensitivity than the corresponding serologic test. The time between the infectious exposure andthe development of a positive assay result is called the windowperiod (19 –22). False-positive assays have been reported with all tests but are generally more common in NAT testing.

Net State of Immunosuppression The net state of immunosuppression is a conceptual measure of all factors contributing to the patient’s risk of infection (Table 2) (8). Among these are the following: /C15The speciﬁc immunosuppressive therapy, including dose, duration, and temporal sequence of agents — Intensive treatment of graft rejection poses greateracute risk than chronic immunosuppression. /C15Technical problems in the transplant procedure, resulting in leaks (blood, lymph, urine) and ﬂuid col- lections, devitalized tissue, and poor wound healing. /C15Prolonged airway intubation. /C15Use of broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents. /C15Posttransplant renal, hepatic, pulmonary, or cardiac dysfunction, malnutrition or diabetes, advanced age. /C15Prolonged use of urinary, vascular access, or dialysis catheters, surgical drains, or other breaks in skin ormucosal defenses. /C15Infection with immunomodulating viruses including CMV, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), HBV, HCV, or HIV.Most viruses, including community-acquired respira-tory viruses, have local innate or adaptive immune effects predisposing to superinfection. /C15Neutropenia or lymphocytopenia. /C15Genetic polymorphisms in immune response path- ways. The synergies of combinations of immunosuppressive agents or defects in immune function are not quantiﬁable (3). The assessment of pathogen-speciﬁc (i.e. cellular)immune function and its relation to the intensity ofimmunosuppression correlates roughly with the risk of infection in an individual (3,37). Few commercialized assays exist other than for CMV and tuberculosisbut include interferon- c-release assays, ELISpot, MHC- tetramer staining, or intracellular cytokine staining. Serologic assays determine past exposures to variouspathogens but are poorly predictive of the efﬁcacy of immune response to speciﬁc pathogens in the immuno- suppressed host and are often not useful for acutediagnosis. Low serum antibody levels correlate with an overall risk of infection but speciﬁc cutoff values and indications for replacement therapy are lacking (38).Other measures of “global” immune function lack thedesired predictive values for infectious risk (39). Individ- ual drugs are associated with increased risk of certain infections (Table 3) (40); combinations of agents mayenhance risk or cause toxicity. Few data exist on func- tional immune reconstitution after T- or B-lymphocyte depletion or with costimulatory blockade. The contribu-tion of organ dysfunction (e.g. cirrhosis, renal dysfunc- tion) to immune function resists quantiﬁcation. Superimposed surgery (i.e. returns to the operatingroom) or invasive radiologic and endoscopic proceduresto address complications such as bleeding, vascular thromboses, and urinary or biliary leaks or strictures riskcontamination or dissemination of organisms. These effects are ampliﬁed by drug-induced leukopenia or dys- function. Recent data support the importance of genetic polymorphisms among transplant recipients in risk ofmicrobial colonization and infection (1,2,41). Such predis- positions are often unrecognized until additional alter- ations in immune function are introduced. Timetable of infection: With standardized immuno- suppressive regimens, most common infections occur in arelatively predictable patte rn depending on the time elapsed since transplantation (Figure 2). This is a reﬂection of changing risk factors over tim e: surgery/hospitalization, immunosuppression, emergence of latent infections, and community exposures (8). The pattern of infection changes with alterations in the immunosuppressive regimen, includingside effects, viral infections, gr aft dysfunction, or signiﬁcant epidemiologic exposures (e.g., travel or food). Risk also depends on exposures via donor organs. Prophylactic antimicrobial agents will delay, but not eliminate, the“normal” appearance of infect ions. Any reduction in the net state of immunosuppression will reduce risk of infection when prophylaxis is discontinued (43 –46). The time line represents three overlapping periods of risk: (1) the perioperative period to approximately 30 days after transplantation; (2) the period from 1 to 6 –12 months after transplantation (reﬂecting immunosuppression including“induction” therapies and prophylaxis); and (3) beyond 6 –12 months posttransplantation. The time line is used to (1) establish a differential diagnosis for the transplant patient suspected of having infection, (2) identify excess environmental hazards or over-immuno-suppression, and (3) design preventative antimicrobial strategies. Infections occurring at the “wrong” time sug- gest an excessive epidemiologic hazard or excessiveimmunosuppression (8). The prevention of infection is linkedto the expected risk of infection (47) (Tables 6 and 7). Phase I: 1 month posttransplantation: During the ﬁrst month after transplantation, infections result fromsurgical complications, donor-derived infections, pre-existing recipient infections, and nosocomial infections including aspiration or C. difﬁcile colitis. Early infections often reﬂect technical issues (bleeding, strictures, leaks,graft injury) or hospital environmental exposures (e.g. Aspergillus pneumonia with hospital construction). Fevers may be associated with antibody for cellular depletion, transfusions, drug reactions, or graft rejection. Drainage of ﬂuid collections and early removal of lines and drains, limiting antimicrobial agents, and meticulouswound care are essential. Early opportunistic infectionsare uncommon as sustained administration of immunosuppressive agents is generally required to allow organisms of low native virulence to cause invasivedisease. Thus, early Pneumocystis pneumonia is rare without pretransplant immunosuppression.

Phase II: 1 to 6 –12 months posttransplant: Multiple causes of infectious syndromes exist in the transplantrecipient 1 to 6 –12 months posttransplantation. Anti- CMV strategies and TMP-SMZ prophylaxis have altered patterns of posttransplant infections (Figure 2, Tables 6and 7). TMP-SMZ virtually eliminates Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP) and given daily, prevents Toxoplasma gondii , and reduces urinary tract infections, Listeria monocytogenes meningitis, and many Nocardia species infections (8,48). Notably, other agents substituted for TMP-SMZ in sulfa-allergic patients offer less protection. Effective anti-CMV prophylaxis shouldprevent most CMV infections (and herpes zoster, herpessimplex virus [HSV], human herpesvirus [HHV] 6 and 7, and primary EBV) for the duration of therapy (Table 6). Inthe patient not receiving anti-CMV prophylaxis, protection against varicella zoster virus (VZV) and HSV remain useful (49 –51). The differential diagnosis of infectious syndromes in this period includes the following: Graft rejection, particularly in regimens without induc- tion, corticosteroids, or calcineurin inhibitors Lingering infection from the perisurgical period includ- ingC. difﬁcile colitis, residual pneumonia, or technical issues (e.g. anastomotic leaks, empyema, cholangitis, infected hematoma).Figure 2: The timeline of infections following organ transplantation. The pattern of common infections following organ transplan- tation varies with the net state of immunosuppression and the epidemiology of infectious exposures. Development of disease is delayed, but not eliminated by prophylaxis including vaccinations and antimicrobial agents. Individual risk is modiﬁed by events includ- ing treatment for graft rejection or malignancy. Thickness of line indicates relative risk. Bold type indicates infections potentially pre-ventable by prophylaxis.

Either a molecu- lar CMV viral load test or a pp65 antigenemia assay may be used for monitoring. Monitoring should be performed once weekly after transplantation for 12 –24 weeks. Infections indicated by positive assays are treated with either oral valganciclovir or intravenous ganci- clovir. Therapy is continued at least until viremia is undetectable. 2Longer prophylaxis for heart and lung recipients is commonly employed although data are limited. 3Hybrid prophylaxis: Many centers prefer universal prophylaxis for highest risk kidney recipients (D +/R/C0or R+with lymphocyte deple- tion) and pre-emptive therapy for lower-risk groups.

Opportunistic infection due to Pneumocystis jiroveci , L. monocytogenes ,T. gondii ,Nocardia species, Asper- gillus species, endemic fungi, often following immunomodulating viral infection (Table 8). Viral infections have a central role, notably in immuno- suppressed and immunologically na €ıve seronegative recipients of seropositive donor organs. Each virus pro- duces a set of clinical syndromes or “direct effects”(e.g. fever, pneumonitis, hepatitis, leukopenia) as well as a variety of “indirect” or cellular effects including (1) local or systemic immunosuppression predisposing to subse-quent opportunistic infections; (2) stimulation of innateimmune responses that may augment alloreactivity; and (3) cellular proliferation including malignancies (posttrans-plant lymphoproliferative disorder [PTLD], anogenital can-cers) and organ-speciﬁc injuries including accelerated atherogenesis (hearts) or chronic lung allograft dysfunc- tion (CLAD) with bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (lungs)(52,53). Phase III: more than 6 –12 months posttransplant: Later posttransplant, recipients with satisfactory allograft functionwill tolerate reduced maintenance immunosuppression with lowered risk of infection.

gardening. Most clinicians have patients who decide to clean their attic ( Aspergillus, Cryptococcus ), muck out the barn ( Rhodococcus equi , hantavirus), or explore the world (malaria, Salmonella sp., dengue). Occasionally, such patients will develop primary CMV infection (socially acquired) or infections related to underlying conditions (e.g. skin infections in diabetics). Some recipients will developrelapsing viral infection. In the past, and in regions withoutaccess to antiviral therapies, this was driven by CMV, HBV, HCV, and HIV. At present, major challenges include late CMV (occasionally with antiviral resistance), EBV (as PTLD),BK polyomavirus infection, and papillomavirus (anogenital cancers and warts). Most attention is required by individuals with tenuous graft function with higher levels of maintenance suppres- sion. These patients suffer recurrent infections (pancre-atitis, cholangitis, abscesses, urinary tract infections, pneumonia) necessitating hospitalization and antimicro- bial therapy. Attempts to reduce the intensity ofimmunosuppression provoke humoral and cellular graftrejection. They develop progressive colonization by antimicrobial-resistant ﬂora including fungi, complications of therapy (e.g. C. difﬁcile colitis, bleeding from graft biopsies), renal dysfunction (calcineurin inhibitor toxicity, sepsis, radiographic contrast exposure), and increased immunosuppression to “save” the graft. This subgroupof transplant recipients has been termed the “chronic ne’er-do-wells,” and risk common opportunistic patho- gens (e.g. P. jiroveci ,L. monocytogenes ,N. asteroides , Aspergillus species, or Cryptococcus neoformans ) (48) and more unusual infections (e.g. Listeria, Rhodococcus, Cryptosporidium, Microsporidium ), molds ( Scedosporium , agents of mucormycosis, Phaeohyphomycoses), andcommon diseases (herpes zoster, HSV) of unusual sever- ity.Minimal clinical signs or symptoms merit careful eval- uation in this group of “high-risk” individuals. This group may beneﬁt from lifelong TMP-SMZ or prolonged antifun- gal prophylaxis. Approaches to common infectious syndromes in transplantation General approaches As was noted, the beneﬁts of early, speciﬁc antimicrobial therapy and avoidance of therapeutic toxicities empha-size the need for rapid and speciﬁc diagnosis in trans- plant recipients with infectious syndromes. Appropriate cultures must be obtained in advance of antimicrobial therapy to avoid prolonged courses of unnecessaryagents. Similarly, technical problems merit early and deﬁnitive therapy —drainage of ﬂuid collections, opening of blocked vessels or ducts —before the impact on graft and patient become irreversible or patients become too ill for such procedures. Invasive approaches are often subject to interspecialty negotiations —as in any sick, complex patient. Advanced imaging with interventionalradiology may assist in selection of the best approach (Table 8). Reduction in immunosuppression, while con- ceptually sound, risks graft rejection or immune reconsti- tution syndromes (e.g. in cryptococcal meningitis) (7,54).Acute allograft rejection may be less common during some acute viral infections (e.g. CMV, EBV), risking sub- sequent graft rejection with antiviral therapy or reductionin immunosuppression. This effect is inconsistent andviral infection and rejection may be observed together (e.g. with BK polyomavirus nephropathy, HCV). Reduc- tion in speciﬁc immunosuppressives should be roughlylinked to the host responses desired for the pathogens encountered —e.g. steroids for bacteria and fungi, cal- cineurin inhibitors for viruses, cell cycle agents in neu-tropenia, m-TOR inhibitors for wound dehiscence and pulmonary processes —recognizing that each agent has multiple effects on the immune system. Some immunedeﬁcits (neutropenia, hypogammaglobulinemia) may respond to adjunctive therapies (colony-stimulating fac- tors or antibody repletion) (38). Cytomegalovirus (CMV) CMV remains an important pathogen in transplant recipi- ents despite generally effective antiviral therapies (46,55,56). The nature of CMV infection varies with thespeciﬁc viral isolate, antiviral susceptibility, the site of infection, and the quality of the host’s immune response (52). The reservoir for latent CMV infection is largelymonocytes, affecting innate immune responses to organ- isms such as Pneumocystis and Aspergillus . CMV repli- cates in all transplanted organs (nephritis, hepatitis,carditis, pneumonitis, pancreatitis) and vessels in ﬁbrob- lasts, epithelial, endothelial, and other parenchymal cells. Infections caused by multiple viral strains are commonlyassociated with higher viral loads with delayed clearanceand higher rates of recurrence (41,57). Epidemiology: Without prophylaxis, infection is most common 1 to 6 months after transplantation depending on the organ, the immunosuppressive regimen, and the host’s immune status. The greatest risk in transplantrecipients is primary infection in immunologically na €ıve, seronegative recipients (R /C0) of seropositive organs (D +) with up to a 91.9% incidence of viremia and 50 –65% rate of symptomatic infection by 90 days posttransplant without prophylaxis (47,55). In D +R/C0transplant recipients, virus-speciﬁc, cytotoxic T cell immunity may be impairedin the graft due to MHC mismatch between donor andrecipient. Measurement of CMV-speciﬁc T cell function is a useful guide to the need for prophylaxis; serology is a surrogate marker (16,58). Approximately 40 –60% of seropositive recipients (R +) develop viremia without prophylaxis (55). Lung recipients (D +or R+) are at high risk for viral activation and for adverse effects of CMVinfection. Primary CMV infection in seronegative individuals after transfusion or sexual contact is often severe; transmission may occur ( /C254%) even with use of leukoreduced or seronegative blood products.

symptomatic infections are rare during effective antiviral prophylaxis but may occur after the cessation of prophylaxis with 25 –40% developing symptomatic disease (46). Risk is ampliﬁed by other inﬂammatoryprocesses (graft rejection, fever) with tumor necrosis factor- arelease, coinfection with other herpesviruses (HHV-6 and -7), and intensiﬁcation of immunosuppressionwith bolus corticosteroids or T cell depletion. Risk appearsto be reduced by regimens including m-TOR inhibitors (sirolimus, everolimus) (59). Clinical features: Many viremic infections are asymptomatic. “Viral syndrome” presents with fever,leukopenia, and myalgias, often with mild hepatitis. Invasive disease is often focused in the allograft. Common presentations include pancolitis with ulcerationand bleeding as well as inﬂammation of multiple organs.Retinitis, encephalitis, and central nervous system (CNS) vasculitis are uncommon. Immune effects amplify the risk for opportunistic infections including P. jiroveci , Listeria ,Candida , and Aspergillus species, EBV (PTLD), and HHV6 and 7 (60). Diagnosis and management: International standards exist for quantitative molecular assays (QNAT) used in pre-emptive therapy, diagnosis, and management ofCMV infections (58,61 –64). QNAT has largely supplanted antigenemia assays. Serologic tests are useful prior to transplantation to predict risk but neither IgG nor IgMserum levels are useful for the diagnosis of acute infection; in transplantation, seroconversion is generally delayed. CMV cell cultures are slow and insensitive fordiagnosis and were used in antiviral resistance studies. Notably, CMV secretion in sputum or urine is of little diagnostic utility. The presence of CMV inclusions orimmunostaining by histology in the appropriate clinicalsetting is the “gold standard” for the diagnosis of tissue- invasive CMV disease. QNAT testing of blood detects most systemic disease but viral loads during infection ofthe gastrointestinal tract and CNS are generally lower than for other sites. In transplant recipients with ulcerative colonic or gastric lesions or diffuse erythemaor bleeding, CMV must be considered even with low or undetectable viremia (65). In practice, the use of QNAT in the management of CMV infections varies between clinical centers and by patient populations (66). In CMV treatment, assays are used to demonstrate virologic responses and endpoints(negative assay) for therapy (26). Virologic responses to therapy generally require 7 or more days; thus, repeated samples at less than weekly intervals carry no advan-tage. Monitoring schedules for prevention are linked to the patient’s status. In the high-risk patient (D +/R/C0or R+ with antithymocyte globulins) most centers use prophy-laxis for 3 –6 months posttransplant, and may usebiweekly or monthly screening to assure the absence of infection for an additional 3 –6 months (66). In pre-emptive monitoring for R +or D/C0/R/C0patients, weekly or biweekly monitoring is employed in the ﬁrst months posttransplantwith therapy initiated for positive assays. Monitoring or prophylaxis is required following intensiﬁed immunosup- pression for graft rejection. No speciﬁc viral load cutoffsare available to initiate antiviral therapy. However, persis-tent low-level viremia ( <2500 IU) suggests excess immunosuppression or stimulation by other infections or processes (e.g. rejection). Cellular and immunological effects: Control of CMV infection is largely via MHC-restricted, virus-speciﬁc, cytotoxic T lymphocyte response (CD8 +cells) (16,26,67). CD4+lymphocytes are important in the maintenance of the cellular immune response. Neutralizing antibodyresponses appear to be important clinically; seroconversion correlates roughly with the presence but not the quality of cellular immune responses. Human CMV (HCMV)glycoprotein B is involved in cellular attachment and penetration by CMV and is a target of neutralizing antibodies and a major component of recent HCMVvaccines (68). HCMV interacts with Toll-like receptors (TLR9 and TLR3) to activate inﬂammatory cytokine pathways and activate costimulatory pathways (55).Macrophages, dendritic cells, and natural killer (NK) cellsparticipate in the innate immune response to CMV. The precise role of cdT-cells remains to be deﬁned (52). The cellular and immunological effects of CMV (“indirect effects”) may be as important in transplantation as inva- sive viral infections (8,52,53). The mechanisms for theseeffects are complex and relate to viral evasion strategies to antiviral responses. The bidirectional linkage between CMV infection and graft injury has been observed in mul- tiple clinical trials of cardiac, lung, liver, and kidney trans-plantation (60,69 –72). CMV contributes to graft ﬁbrosis, possibly via proﬁbrotic and vasculopathic growth factors such as TGF- b, platelet-derived growth factor, connective tissue growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, and adhesion molecules including intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (52).Intensive prophylaxis targeting both symptomatic disease and asymptomatic infection protects against chronic graft injury including cardiac vasculopathy and CLAD (60,69 – 71). Prevention: Prevention of CMV infection varies by the organ transplanted, the immunosuppressive regimen, and patient risk (27,28,47,55,73). Prophylaxis using ganciclovir, valganciclovir, high-dose acyclovir, or relatedagents has the possible advantage of preventing both CMV as well as many HSV, VZV, HHV6, and HHV7 infections. Breakthrough VZV and HSV may reﬂectneurologic latency or reduced susceptibility. Furthermore,in the highest risk cohorts (D +R/C0), the indirect effects of 866 American Journal of Transplantation 2017; 17: 856–879Fishman  16006143, 2017, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajt.14208 by Cochrane Germany, Wiley Online Library on [07/12/2023].

CMV (i.e. graft rejection, opportunistic infections, and mortality) are reduced by universal prophylaxis compared with pre-emptive therapy; breakthrough disease during prophylaxis with valganciclovir is uncommon. In practiceneither strategy is perfect. Replication after completion of prophylaxis reaches 17 –37% in D +/R/C0recipients, emphasizing beneﬁts of reduced immunosuppressionand postprophylaxis monitoring (45,74,75). CMVseropositivity is a useful guide to risk for viremia and invasive disease; up to a third of D +/R/C0recipients have delayed seroconversion. CMV-speciﬁc T cell immuneresponse assays are useful for this purpose (16,17). In renal recipients, prophylaxis for 200 days or a hybrid scheme (3 months of prophylaxis and 3 months of pre- emptive monitoring) in D +/R/C0renal recipients is com- mon (45,66). In seropositive (R +) recipients, 3 months of prophylaxis or pre-emptive therapy is commonly employed in the absence of T-cell depletion for induction. With T cell depletion, 3 –6 months of prophylaxis may be preferred. Valganciclovir dosing should not be reducedfor neutropenia during prophylaxis to avoid selection of ganciclovir-resistant strains. Instead, consider reduction in mycophenolate mofetil dosing or use of granulocytecolony-stimulating factor to support the neutrophil count with formal measurements of creatinine clearance to guide dose adjustments. Prophylactic TMP-SMZ isuncommonly the source of clinically signiﬁcant neutrope- nia. If the correct dose of ganciclovir cannot be tolerated, prophylaxis can be replaced with pre-emptive monitoring. Heart, liver, pancreas, intestine, and vascularized com- posite allograft recipients at risk for primary infection (CMV D +/R/C0) generally receive prophylaxis for 3 – 6 months after transplantation (Table 6) (46,76). Many centers utilize 6 months of prophylaxis in CMV D +/R/C0or R+patients receiving lymphocyte-depleting induction (45,66). Lung transplant recipients may beneﬁt from pro- longed (1 year) prophylaxis (43,77). Other groups are can- didates for preemptive therapy ifan appropriate monitoring system is in place and patient compliance isadequate (66). The added beneﬁt of monthly CMV hyper- immune globulin for 3 –6 months in cardiac and lung recipients is not well studied with current antiviralagents. Hypogammaglobulinemia requires intravenous immune globulin therapy (46,78,79). Treatment: The standard of care for treating CMV disease is at least 2 –3 weeks of therapy with intravenous ganciclovir (5 mg/kg twice daily, with dosageadjustments for renal dysfunction) or valganciclovir (900 mg po twice daily corrected for renal function). As clearance of viremia within 21 days is approximately50%, most centers treat for two negative weekly QNAT assays followed by monitoring or prophylaxis for up to 3 months. Oral valganciclovir is noninferior tointravenous ganciclovir for the treatment of patients with mild-to-moderately severe CMV disease with modestviral loads (80). Oral therapy may fail in patients with high viral loads and invasive gastrointestinal disease. Seronegative patients with poor clinical or virologic responses to therapy are at heightened risk for relapseand antiviral resistance; prolonged therapy, or secondary prophylaxis for 2 –4 months of oral valganciclovir (900 mg daily based on creatinine clearance) is reasonable (81).The addition of 3 months of CMV hyperimmune globulin(150 mg/kg/dose iv monthly) does not appear to be justiﬁed in the absence of hypogammaglobulinemia. Relapses appear to be more frequent in gastrointestinaldisease initially treated with oral therapy and in individuals not treated to a negative quantitative assay. In practice, therapy may be initiated with intravenous ororal therapy with monitoring weekly to demonstrate a response. While spontaneous CMV ganciclovir antiviral resistance occurs, this complication is most common in the higher- risk groups with inadequate dosing of antiviral agents,often following dose reduction for neutropenia. Ganci-clovir resistance is most common in lung transplant recipients, in D +/R/C0recipients, with high viral loads, inadequate dosing of prophylactic or therapeutic ganci- clovir, more intensive immunosuppression including anti- lymphocyte antibody induction, and with prolonged antiviral prophylaxis (82). Clinically, the viral load or clini-cal syndrome fails to respond to appropriate therapy. Genetic resistance testing is useful in managing resistant CMV infection; mutations in the viral UL97 (thymidinekinase) or UL54 (DNA polymerase) genes can confer gan-ciclovir resistance (83,84). Some common UL97 muta- tions respond to higher doses of intravenous ganciclovir while combined mutations (UL97 and UL54) may mani-fest high-level resistance to ganciclovir and cidofovir. Alternative antiviral therapies are available in intravenous form only. These include foscarnet and cidofovir. Foscar-net is active against many ganciclovir-resistant strains of CMV, although associated with marked magnesium and potassium wasting, seizures (notably with calcineurininhibitor therapy), and some renal toxicity. Cidofovir risks signiﬁcant nephrotoxicity and ocular toxicity. Combination therapy (ganciclovir and foscarnet) is not widely used(85). Speciﬁc UL54 mutations may cause resistance tofoscarnet and cidofovir (83,84). Some centers reduce immunosuppression during therapy. Addition of hyperim- mune globulins may reduce viral load but clinical beneﬁtis undocumented. Adoptive CMV-speciﬁc or polyfunc- tional T cell therapies are increasingly available for treat- ment of resistant infections (86,87). Multiple courses ofantiviral therapy may be needed to cure resistant CMV infection. Investigational drugs include: Maribavir, a UL97 protein kinase inhibitor, with in vitro activity against gan- ciclovir- or cidofovir-resistant CMV; Letermovir (AIC-246),a CMV-speciﬁc terminase inhibitor, available orally or intravenously with activity against drug-resistant CMV in vitro ; and Brincidofovir (CMX-001), an oral agent with broad activity against herpesviruses, adenoviruses, American Journal of Transplantation 2017; 17: 856–879 867Infection in Organ Transplantation  16006143, 2017, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajt.14208 by Cochrane Germany, Wiley Online Library on [07/12/2023].

polyomaviruses, papillomaviruses, and variola virus with some gastrointestinal toxicities. Leﬂunomide has some activity against CMV and BK virus but is often ineffective for therapy; possible hepatotoxicity requires drug-levelmonitoring. Artesunate has in vitro activity against herpes viruses but clinical trials are lacking. Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) Epidemiology: EBV is a gamma herpesvirus with seroprevalence rates of approximately 50% by age 5 in developed countries and over 90% in adults worldwide. In immunocompetent individuals, infection presents as achildhood febrile respiratory illness or as infectious mononucleosis of young adults with fever, lymphaden- opathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and hepatitis. Aftertransplantation, EBV seronegative individuals are at riskfor primary infection, which is associated with greatly increased risk of PTLD (88,89). Epidemiology: PTLD occurs in up to 20% of pediatric organ recipients but less than 1% of adults. Most PTLDreﬂects EBV infection of B-lymphocytes, but T cell, NKcell, null cell, and EBV-negative forms occur. Risk factors for PTLD include primary EBV infection (10- to 76-fold increased risk), CMV donor –recipient serostatus mismatch (D+R/C0), T cell depletion, younger age in children, older age in adults, and intensity of immunosuppression (88,90). Viral burden in transplanted lymphoid tissues maycontribute to increased rates of disease in intestinal transplantation in children (up to 32%) while kidney (1 – 2%), heart, lung, liver, and pancreas are lower (3 –12%) (91,92). PTLD may also occur in the absence of EBV infection or in seropositive recipients (93,94). Speciﬁc calcineurin inhibitors do not appear to increase risk, whilem-TOR inhibitors may increase risk (95). Belatacept asmaintenance immunotherapy has a higher associated rate of PTLD in EBV D +R/C0recipients, notably involving the CNS. (96,97). HLA polymorphisms may modulate the riskfor PTLD (98). Clinical presentation: Primary EBV infection tends to present in the ﬁrst year posttransplant. In immuno- suppressed transplant recipients, primary EBV infection may be asymptomatic or cause a febrile mononucleosissyndrome with B cell lymphocytosis with or without lymphadenopathy, atypical lymphocytosis, exudative pharyngitis, meningitis, hepatitis, or pancreatitis. Remit-ting–r e l a p s i n gE B Vi n f e c t i o ni sc o m m o ni nc h i l d r e na n d may suggest relative overimmune suppression. Persistent low-level EBV viremia may suggest increasedrisk for PTLD; the management of such patients remainsunclear. The clinical presentation of EBV-associated disease includes the following:/C15Asymptomatic /C15Unexplained fever or weight loss. /C15Mononucleosis-like syndromes or tonsillar swelling. /C15Gastrointestinal bleeding, obstruction, perforation, orabdominal mass lesions /C15Inﬁltrative disease of the allograft (often donor-derived;confused with rejection) /C15Focal CNS dysfunction or meningitis /C15Pulmonary or other organ inﬁltration PTLD presents at any time posttransplantation with a bimodal pattern of onset in the ﬁrst year and then beyond 5–7 years. The spectrum of PTLD includes polymorphic (polyclonal) and monomorphic hyperplasias to B cell neo-plasms, T cell neoplasms, and Hodgkin lymphomas. Less commonly, other forms of lymphoid neoplasms and smooth muscle tumors occur. Compared with the generalpopulation, PTLD has increased extranodal involvement,poor response to conventional therapies, and poor out- comes. Late PTLD includes more monomorphic B cell tumors, EBV-negative proliferations (up to /C2520%), or NK cell or T cell tumors (99,100). T cell, NK cell, and null cell tumors are common in some adult series and are more often monomorphic with worse prognosis. Other negativeprognostic indicators include CNS disease, disease in mul- tiple body sites, EBV-negative PTLD, disease of recipient origin, and the presence of mutations in proto-oncogenesor tumor-suppressor genes. Atypical presentations include hemolytic anemia, hemophagocytosis, and thrombocy- topenia. Prevention: All donors and recipients should undergo EBV serologic testing prior to transplantation. There areinsufﬁcient data to support routine use of antiviral prophylaxis in the D +R/C0population (101); reduction in the intensity of immunosuppression risks rejection. A pre-emptive strategy is most often applied based onposttransplant QNAT screening of higher-risk patients (EBV serology D +R/C0) (93,94,102). Viremic patients are candidates for reduction in immunosuppression; failure toclear viremia should raise concerns for PTLD (103,104). Insufﬁcient data exist to support routine use of antivirals, anti-B cell therapies, or adoptive immunotherapy in suchindividuals. Diagnosis and therapy: The diverse presentations of EBV-associated disease complicate diagnosis. Graft dysfunction in the presence of EBV viremia should suggest inﬁltrating PTLD as well as rejection. Radiologic imaging forperforation, obstruction, or gastrointestinal bleeding will often be the ﬁrst clue to the presence of mass lesions; EBV and CMV QNAT assays should be obtained. Speciﬁcviral load cutoffs are not available with serial assays most useful in individuals (88,94,102,105 –107). In normal hosts, primary infection is assessed using IgG and IgM antibodies to viral capsid antigen, antibodies to 868 American Journal of Transplantation 2017; 17: 856–879Fishman  16006143, 2017, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajt.14208 by Cochrane Germany, Wiley Online Library on [07/12/2023].

early antigen, and nuclear antigen (EBNA). These responses are often delayed with immunosuppression; anti-EBNA titers may fall in seropositive hosts with onset of PTLD (108). Transfusion of blood products confusesanalysis. Tissue histopathology is required for diagnosis and staging with the spectrum of PTLD deﬁned by World Health Organization standards (109,110). EBV-speciﬁcnucleic acids can be detected in tissue by in situ hybridization for EBV-encoded small nuclear RNAs (EBER) and EBV lytic or latent antigens (EBNA-1, EBNA- 2, LMP-1, BZLF1) by immunostaining. Immunophenotyp-ing (e.g. CD20) for cell lineage determination of tumors is essential. Molecular genetic markers are used to assess tumor clonality and HLA staining to assess donorversus recipient origins. Immune assays (ELISPOT or EBV-speciﬁc tetramer assays) may be useful in strategiz- ing; commercial ATP release assays require furtherstudy. In EBV-negative PTLD, standard hematologic diag- nostic criteria must be applied. Therapy must be individualized (111). In general, EBV + polyclonal disease in seropositive individuals has some response to reduction of immunosuppression. Prospec- tive trials of antiviral therapy for PTLD are lacking; currentdata do not support a role for antivirals in PTLD (104). Treatment of CMV coinfection is warranted. Alternate therapies may be required for extranodal and monoclonalmalignant PTLDs. Combinations of anti-B cell therapy (anti-CD20), chemotherapy (CHOP), and/or adoptive immunotherapy with stimulated T cells have been utilized(88,112,113). CNS disease may require addition of irradia-tion or chemotherapy. The duration of response is often disappointing. Relapses may be accompanied by EBV vir- emia. Graft rejection may complicate withdrawal ofimmunosuppression during treatment of malignancy. Polyomaviruses Epidemiology: Polyomaviruses are a growing family of common, small, nonenveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses that infect multiple species including humans (114).SV40 was identiﬁed from African Green Monkey cells used to produce polio and adenovirus vaccines. Polyomaviruses have been identiﬁed in transplant recipients in associationwith tubulointerstitial nephritis and nephropathy (polyomavirus-associated nephropathy [PyVAN] with BK virus [BKV], and JC virus [JCV]) and ureteric stenosis (BKV)demyelinating disease of the brain (JCV in progressive multifocal encephalopathy, PML), in Trichodysplasia spinulosa, in some malignancies (Merkel cell carcinoma)and condylomata as well as in polyomavirus hemorrhagiccystitis (PvVHC) and occasionally nephritis in stem cell transplant recipients. Tissue receptors for the human viruses are ubiquitous. Disease is generally restricted toimmunocompromised hosts. Adult seroprevalence is 40 –100% for all of the poly- omaviruses; transmission is thought to be oral orrespiratory and is generally asymptomatic. BKV infection (type 1 in 70 –80%, type 4 in 10 –20%) occurs in 1 –10% of renal recipients. BKV achieves latency in renal tubular epithelial cells with asymptomatic urinary shedding in upto half of renal recipients. BKV infection generally origi- nates from the kidney allograft. Up to 30% of renal recip- ients with viruria develop viremia and will generallyprogress to nephropathy without intervention. Outside ofrenal transplantation, viruria is rarely associated with vire- mia (115). The risk for PyVAN is increased with greater MHC mismatch, deceased donor organs, BKV serologicmismatch (D +/R/C0), high-titer donor antibodies to BKV (possibly due to recent infection), older age recipients, lower-titer donor antibodies to BKV, greater intensity ofimmunosuppression including T cell depletion and bolus steroids, acute graft rejection, ureteric stenting, and low cellular immune responses to BKV. Retransplantation forPyVAN is also a risk factor for reinfection. JCV has been isolated from renal tissues and may cause nephropathy but has major tropism for neural tissues. Reactivationoccurs with immunodeﬁciency and tissue injury (e.g.ischemia –reperfusion). In the absence of effective antivi- ral therapies, screening and management of infection in renal recipients is recommended. Clinical presentation: BK polyomavirus (BKPyV) infection: In renal transplant recipients, BKPyV is associated with viruria and viremia, ureteric ulceration and stenosis, and polyomavirus-associated nephropathy (PyVAN or PVAN) (115). PVAN is rarely recognized inrecipients of nonrenal organs, suggesting the need for renal injury (e.g. ischemia –reperfusion or drugs) to cause nephropathy. The role of BKPyV in other syndromes(pneumonitis, hemophagocytic syndrome, encephalitis, or PML) is unclear. In the absence of screening, patients often present with diminished renal allograft function or,less often, with obstruction due to ureteric smooth muscle proliferation. In the face of renal dysfunction, a presumptive diagnosis of PVAN may be made based on elevated plasma BK viral load (discussed below) without obstruction by renal ultrasound. Biopsy with immunohistopathology is gener-ally needed to distinguish PVAN from graft rejection and/ or drug toxicity. Patients with BK nephropathy treated with bolus corticosteroids have a high rate of graft loss,while reducing immunosuppression risks rejection (115). Screening and diagnosis: Screening of renal recipients for BKV both for renal dysfunction and routinely (e.g. months 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and possibly annually years 2–5) allows reduction in immunosuppression for immunological viral clearance before signiﬁcant renal injury has occurred. Screening generally utilizes plasma (or whole blood) viral load (VL) molecular assays. Urine studies (cytology for “decoy cells,” BKV DNA or VP-1mRNA) are less speciﬁc. Decoy cells are shed infected tubular and ureteric epithelial cells with an enlarged American Journal of Transplantation 2017; 17: 856–879 869Infection in Organ Transplantation  16006143, 2017, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajt.14208 by Cochrane Germany, Wiley Online Library on [07/12/2023].

nucleus with a large basophilic intranuclear inclusion by urine cytology. Cytology cannot distinguish BKV from adenovirus and false negative tests also occur. A urinary test for BKV (cytology for decoy cells or urine BKV loadsover 7 log geq/mL) is adequate for screening; if negative, the risk for PVAN is low. Quantitative cutoffs for presumptive diagnosis of BKV nephropathy includeplasma DNA VL >10 4copies/mL (whole blood polymerase chain reaction [PCR] VL >1500 –3500 copies/mL), urine VP- 1 mRNA load >6.59105copies/ng total RNA, or urine DNA load >107copies/mL; higher viral loads are increasingly predictive of PyVAN. Interlaboratory variability in the performance of BKV QNAT should be reduced using World Health Organization standards. Biopsy is suggestedfor conﬁrmation if creatinine is elevated. Renal histopathology provides deﬁnitive diagnosis of PyVAN, although the lesions are often focal and may be missedon biopsy. The histopathology of PyVAN includes tubulointerstitial nephritis with cytopathic changes and positive immunohistochemistry using antibodies generallytargeting cross-reacting SV40 large T antigen or BKVantigens or by in situ hybridization for BKV nucleic acids. Fibrosis is often prominent with occasional calciﬁcation. The histologic appearance may mimic or coexist withcellular rejection. Recognition of tubulitis in areas distinct from those containing viral cytopathic changes suggests that acute rejection is present. SV40 staining does notdistinguish BKV from JCV. Tissue (intranuclear viral inclusions) and urine electron microscopy may detect BKV particles and tubular injury. The histologic staging ofPyVAN is reviewed elsewhere (115). JCV-mediated PyVAN should be considered in those with histologic evidence of disease in the absence of BKV by NAT andurine assays. Treatment There is no accepted treatment for PVAN other than reduction in the intensity of immune suppression forthose with sustained viral loads. It is reasonable, and controversial, to reduce dosing of both calcineurin inhibi- tors and antimetabolites in a stepwise fashion (25 –50% per step) to allow anti-BK T cell activity while monitoring BKV plasma loads. Regardless of approach, renal func- tion (1 –2 times per week), drug levels, and viral loads (al- ternate weeks) must be monitored during reductions(115). Rebiopsy may be needed for poor response. Adjunctive antiviral therapies remain controversial. Some centers use cidofovir for BK nephropathy in low doses (0.25 –1 mg/kg every 2 weeks). Signiﬁcant renal toxicity is common with cidofovir; lipid-conjugated cidofovir isunder study for this indication. Leﬂunomide, an agent with some antiviral activity for BKV (with monitoring drug levels) and intravenous immunoglobulin lack clinical trialsdata and US Food and Drug Administration approval forthis indication. Fluoroquinolones have not proven useful for therapy (116).Immunology: Retransplantation has been successful in PVAN patients with failed allografts, possibly due to developing immunity. Retransplantation is best delayed until immunosuppression has been completelydiscontinued for some period (6 months) and BKV is undetectable in blood and low in urine. Measurements of viral loads, BKV-speciﬁc cellular immunity, and humoralalloimmunity off immunosuppression may guide timingfor retransplantation (117). Surgical removal of the allograft does not protect against future BK infection or PVAN but may be needed if immunosuppression cannotbe reduced (double transplants, allosensitization) or elevated viral loads persist. Graft rejection may occur after reduction in immunosuppression and treatmentmay provoke relapse. A brisk inﬂammatory response may occur with immune reconstitution as immuno- suppression is reduced. JC polyomavirus (JCV): PML results from CNS infection by JCV and is uncommon in solid organ recipients (118). This demyelinating disorder presents with focal neurologic deﬁcits or seizures as well as with more slowlyprogressive neurologic lesions and may progress to death. PML may be confused with calcineurin neurotoxicity; both may respond to a reduction in drug levels. No proventherapies exist for PML, although reduction of immunosuppression is commonly employed. Diagnosis is suggested by a compatible neurologic syndrome,radiologic evidence of demyelination, and evidence of JCVinfection of cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF). Conﬁrmation requires brain biopsy with immunohistologic staining. JCV has been implicated in some cases of BKV-negativePyVAN. Human papillomavirus (HPV) HPV is a family of double-stranded DNA viruses, mem-bers of which have tropism for basal epithelial cells of the transformation zone of the cervix, mucous mem- branes, and keratinized skin. Spread is by person-to-per-son, generally sexual contact. HPV infection is associatedwith anogenital and skin precancers, cancers, and warts associated with human HPV infections. The existence of latent infection by HPV is unproven. Immunosuppression,notably of cell-mediated responses, increases the rate of HPV-associated premalignancy and relapse of prior HPV infections (119 –123). Anogenital warts tend to be caused by lower cancer risk HPV types (e.g. 6 and 11) but should be seen as a marker for possible carriage of higher-risk types for cervical and anal cancers including16 and 18. Association with head and neck cancers and respiratory infections require further study. Routine gyne- cological and skin screening is mandatory for transplantrecipients. Pretransplant vaccination appears to protectagainst vaccine strains in uninfected individuals. HIV Successful organ transplantation in HIV-infected indi-viduals is a reﬂection of advances in highly active 870 American Journal of Transplantation 2017; 17: 856–879Fishman  16006143, 2017, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajt.14208 by Cochrane Germany, Wiley Online Library on [07/12/2023].

antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and immune monitoring in transplantation (124 –127). This success should be enhanced by HCV antiviral therapy in coinfected individu- als. Successful management of HIV transplants includesa stable pretransplant ART regimen with adequate CD4 + cell counts and full transplant immunosuppression includ- ing T cell depletion therapy if indicated. Failure to provideadequate immunosuppression has been associated withincreased rates of acute graft rejection by 30% among kidney and twofold among liver recipients with HIV (127,128). Meticulous tracking of immunosuppressivedrug levels and toxicities, avoidance of protease inhibi- tors in ART selection if possible, and knowledge of HIV susceptibility patterns are required (129,130). HCV-HIVcoinfection carries an important negative impact on liver transplant outcomes (128,131,132); the effect of directly active anti-HCV therapies is under investigation. Preven-tion of opportunistic infections in HIV +recipients is based on reconstitution with HAART. Individuals with exposures to potential pathogens prior to transplantationand/or prior to receiving HAART (e.g. Toxoplasma gondii,thrush, HPV, or Pneumocystis, mycobacteria, Coccid- ioides, and Histoplasma species) may require monitoring and prophylaxis posttransplantation beyond the standardof care. Donors with HIV infection or HCV infection are now being used at some centers with expertise in antivi- ral management in transplantation. Fungal infections Reduced corticosteroid use and newer antifungal agents have improved outcomes for fungal infections when cou-pled with therapeutic drug monitoring and fungal suscep- tibility testing. In transplantation, the most common fungal pathogens include Candida and Aspergillus spe- cies, Cryptococcus neoformans , and the endemic mycoses (133 –135) (Figure 2). Highly aggressive species with increased resistance (agents of mucormycosis, Sce- dosporium, Fusarium, Penicillium species) are becoming more common. Common risk factors include prior colo- nization, neutropenia, intensity of immunosuppression, T cell depletion, viral coinfections (CMV, HHV6, andcommunity-acquired respiratory infections), diabetes, broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents, renal and hepatic dysfunction, leukopenia, and critical illness. The azoleantifungal agents have important interactions and toxici-ties in association with immunosuppressive regimens, notably increasing blood levels of the calcineurin and m- TOR inhibitors (136). The echinocandins may alter cal-cineurin and m-TOR inhibitor levels (137 –140). Candida species Candidemia is most often an early posttransplant nosoco-mial infection associated with vascular access catheters, surgical drains, antimicrobial use, peripheral hyperalimen- tation, and diabetes (133). Candidemia may be observedin liver recipients with cholangitis, bile leaks, or hemato- mas. The risk of Candida infection is increased in liverrecipients with choledochojejunostomy over duct-to-duct anastomoses and in pancreas transplantation, notably with enteric drainage (141). Other risk factors include kid- ney and liver allograft dysfunction, intensive care unitstays, vascular access catheters, large volume blood transfusions, re-exploration surgery after abdominal trans- plantation, graft pancreatitis, parenteral hyperalimenta-tion, colonization, and broad-spectrum antimicrobialtherapy (142). Targeted prophylaxis has been applied to reduce Candida infections in liver, small bowel, and pan- creas recipients. All cases of candidemia merit antifungal therapy in addi- tion to removal of vascular access catheters; delayedtherapy carries signiﬁcant mortality (143,144). Candida retinal lesions may be due to endocarditis or endoph- thalmitis. Candida isolates from sterile sites should have susceptibility testing for ﬂuconazole; ﬂuconazole-resistant species are generally echinocandin susceptible. Echinocandin resistance is increasingly identiﬁed (145).Thrush is common; Candida may superinfect esophageal lesions due to HSV, CMV, or cancer. Other than at tra- cheal anastomoses in lung recipients, pulmonary candi- diasis is rare without tissue infarction. Vascularanastomotic infections may lead to the development of mycotic aneurysms with risk of rupture (Figure 3A). Mycotic aneurysms may reﬂect donor-derived infection,contamination during procurement or via preservation ﬂuid (Figure 3A) (146). Candiduria must be evaluated in the absence of urinary catheters and with good urineﬂow; fungal pyelonephritis is uncommon and fungus ballsmust be excluded. Aspergillus species Epidemiology: Invasive Aspergillus infection generally occurs in more debilitated or immunosuppressed organrecipients with mortality estimates with invasive diseaseof 20 to >50% (133,147 –149). The risk of Aspergillus infection is increased by factors including organ retransplantation and reexploration, posttransplant renal or hepatic failure with renal replacement therapy, CMV infection, and hepatitis C coinfection (150 –154). The rates ofAspergillus infections vary by organ and center including livers (1 –9.2%), hearts (1 –14%) (155,156), kidney (0.7 –4%), and pancreas (135,157). Aspergillus isolation is most common in lung recipients withcolonization rates >25%, and invasive infection approaching 6% including tracheobronchitis, bronchial anastomotic infections, and invasive pulmonary (32%) anddisseminated (22%) infections; these rates are greater incystic ﬁbrosis patients and in the native lungs of single lung recipients (148). Airway ischemia and CLAD are risk factors in this population. A. fumigatus is the most common species isolated, while other species are increasingly noted including A. terreus ,A. ﬂavus , and A. niger . All transplant recipients are at risk for sinopulmonary American Journal of Transplantation 2017; 17: 856–879 871Infection in Organ Transplantation  16006143, 2017, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajt.14208 by Cochrane Germany, Wiley Online Library on [07/12/2023].

aspergillosis. Invasive Aspergillus infection may extend to the CNS (Figure 3B), although intracerebral invasion is increasingly attributed to other fungal species including the agents of mucormycosis and Scedosporium species (158). Clinical presentation and evaluation: Pulmonary aspergillosis generally presents with fever, cough with or without hemoptysis, and occasionally pleurisy; CNS symptoms may suggest metastatic infection (Figure 3B).Invasive aspergillosis is a medical emergency. Early speciﬁc diagnosis is essential. Patients with suspicion of infection require imaging, generally by computed tomography (CT)scan, and sampling by bronchoscopy (bronchoalveolar lavage [BAL]) or biopsy for cultures and antifungal susceptibility testing. CT scans may reveal consolidation,nodules with or without halos, or cavitary lesions. Blood cultures are generally negative for Aspergillus ; if available, serum PCR assays are useful when positive. In general, theserum galactomannan (GM) antigenemia assay does notperform well in solid organ recipients and BAL GM samples are preferred. Interpretation of GM in the lungs of patients colonized by Aspergillus requires radiologic or histopathologic conﬁrmation. If available, BAL PCR complements GM when positive. Recommendations for prophylaxis, diagnosis, and treat- ment are reviewed in current Infectious Disease Society of America and International Society for Heart and LungTransplantation guidelines (148,159). Prospective trialsdata are lacking to deﬁne general requirements for anti- Aspergillus prophylaxis other than for lung recipients. Practitioners should develop strategies based on localepidemiology of infection and individual risk factors.CNS infection and Cryptococcus species CNS infection in the transplant recipient is a medical emer- gency. The spectrum of causative organisms is broad. Classic signs (headache, meningismus, fever, Kernig andBrudzinski signs, or papilledema) are often absent. Subtle cranial nerve abnormalities may be useful in diagnosis. Neurologic signs of infection may be obscured by hepaticencephalopathy, uremia, hypoxemia, drug effects (cal- cineurin inhibitors, ﬂuoroquinolones, TMP-SMZ), systemic infection, or alcohol withdrawal and depression. Many CNS infections spread from the lungs or sinuses (Figure 3B). Thus, “metastatic” evaluations are needed, notably for infections due to Aspergillus, agents of mucormycosis, Scedosporium, Cryptococcus ,Nocardia species ,o r Strongyloides stercoralis . Important viral infections include HSV meningoencephalitis, cytomegalo-virus, JC virus (PML), West Nile virus, and varicella zos- ter virus. Common bacterial infections include Listeria monocytogenes , mycobacteria, Nocardia species, and occasionally Salmonella species. Parasites include Toxo- plasma gondii , Microsporidia, and Strongyloides . Speciﬁc diagnosis is essential. Empiric therapy must “cover” Listeria (ampicillin), Cryptococcus (ﬂuconazole or amphotericin), and herpes simplex virus (acyclovir or gan- ciclovir), common bacterial pathogens (vancomycin, cef-triaxone), and known colonizing organisms while awaiting data from lumbar puncture, blood cultures, and radio- graphic studies. Included in the differential diagnosis arenoninfectious etiologies including calcineurin inhibitor tox- icity, posterior reversible encephalopathy, PML, lym- phoma (PTLD), and other malignancies. Uniqueepidemiologic exposures (e.g. Chagas disease, Lyme)must be considered. B A Figure 3: (A) Donor-derived infection of vascular anastomosis due to Candida glabrata .

(B)Brain abscesses (arrows) in neutropenic liver transplant recipient with Aspergillus fumigatus pneumonia. Microbiologic diagnosis was made on samples from needle aspiration of an abscess cavity. Pulmonary infection may spread to the central nervous system in some common infections including those due to Aspergillus ,Scedosporium ,Rhodococcus , and Norcardia species, in mycobacterial infec- tions and with other lung abscesses. 872 American Journal of Transplantation 2017; 17: 856–879Fishman  16006143, 2017, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajt.14208 by Cochrane Germany, Wiley Online Library on [07/12/2023].

Cryptococcus species: Infections due to Cryptococcus neoformans generally occur later posttransplant (160 –162). Meningitis presents with unexplained headaches and fever or altered state of consciousness.Pneumonia, cellulitis, or nodular or papular skin lesions or asymptomatic pulmonary nodules may occur. Unique risk factors include exposures to bird and bat excreta andT cell depletion. Liver recipients are at the greatest riskamong transplant recipients (Figure 4). Diagnosis is by serum and/or CSF cryptococcal antigen assays; all patients require lumbar puncture for cell counts and cultures and CSF pressure measurements. Initial treatment is best with lipid amphotericin and 5-ﬂu-cytosine until cultures are negative and clinical improve- ment is noted; high-dose ﬂuconazole is used until the cryptococcal antigen clears in the CSF and suppressionis maintained for life. Cryptococcus is intrinsically resis- tant to the echinocandins. Cryptococcal antigenemia may persist in serum despite clinical and apparent microbio-logic resolution. Immune reconstitution syndrome orscarring may cause ventricular obstruction with increased CSF pressure and hydrocephalus (161,164). Non- neoformans species including C. gattii ,C. albidus , and C. laurentii have been recognized as pathogens in transplant recipients. These isolates may have elevatedminimum inhibitory concentrations to ﬂuconazole; C. gat- tiimay be hypervirulent and present with disseminated disease with low CSF cryptococcal antigen titers andwith a high attributable mortality. (165,166). Strongyloides stercoralis :S. stercoralis infection may activate decades after exposure with immuno- suppressive therapy. Reactivation presents with fever and diarrheal illness or with parasite migration andhyperinfestation syndrome (ch aracterized by hemorrhagic enterocolitis and/or hemorrhag ic pneumonia) or disseminated infection with accompanying polymicrobial bacteremia or meningitis (167). Eosinophilia is common but is decreasedby corticosteroids. Patients from endemic regions including the southeastern United States should be screened with Strongyloides IgG serology prior to transplantation, and can be treated with ivermectinpreemptively if seropositive. Pneumonitis and Pneumocystis infection Epidemiology: Transplant recipients carry synergistic gaps in pulmonary defenses created by immuno-suppression, neutropenia, and immunosuppressive effects of viral infections on clearance mechanisms. These effects are ampliﬁed in lung recipients by trachealanastomotic narrowing and tissue ischemia, impairedcough reﬂexes, CLAD, decreased pulmonary T cell and macrophage functions with MHC mismatch, hypogam- maglobulinemia, and disrupted lymphatic drainage. Thetimeline of infection is useful in evaluating pneumonitis. In the ﬁrst month after transplantation, pneumonia is caused by reactivation of infection present prior to transplantation(donor or recipient derived) or nosocomially acquired gram- negative bacilli (aspiration) and fungal species. The risk of antimicrobial-resistant infec tion increases with the duration of pretransplant hospitalizations and posttransplantintubation. Superinfection of dysfunctional lung grafts is common, with special concern with bronchial anastomotic infection by Aspergillus . Opportunistic infections are uncommon early without pretransplant immunosuppression. In the period 1 to 12 months after transplant, opportunis- tic infections emerge including PCP, toxoplasmosis, Figure 4: The incidence of speciﬁc invasive fungal infections varies with the organ transplanted. Infection due to Candida spe- cies is most common in all groups. Cryptococcal infection is more common in liver recipients and Aspergillus infection in lung recipi- ents. Recipients of single organ transplants (SOT) are included for each group while multiorgan transplants are included in the totalSOT category.

endemic fungi (e.g. histoplasmosis), and intracellular pathogens including mycobacteria. In this period, viral infections, particularly CMV and community-acquired res- piratory viruses (including metapneumovirus or picor-navirus) cause pneumonia and impair ciliary and macrophage functions to predispose to subsequent infec- tions, including Pneumocystis jirovecii, Aspergillus and endemic fungi, and Nocardia species (168). Increasingly, Nocardia and bacterial species resistant to TMP-SMZ are observed. Greater degrees of immunosuppression and alternative prophylaxis regimens risk Pneumocystis , Nocardia , and more unusual pathogens including Rhodococcus, Toxoplasma, Scedosporium , and Penicil- lium species. PTLD, mycobacterial infections, and ende- mic fungal infections may not be distinguishable on clinical grounds. Speciﬁc microbiological diagnosis is essential. Radiology in the diagnosis of pneumonia: The presentation and evolution of the chest radiograph provide clues to the differential diagnosis of pulmonaryinfection and the diagnostic workup (Table 8). Attention must be paid to comparison with prior studies and the rates of progression of roentgenographic abnormalities inrelation to clinical symptoms. Any radiologic abnor- malities must be considered in light of immuno- suppression. Thoracic CT scans have greater sensitivitythan routine chest radiographs and allow deﬁnition of theextent of disease processes, selection of sites for invasive diagnostic procedures, and response to therapy. Focal or multifocal consolidations of acute onset aremost often bacterial. Multifocal nodular lesions with subacute to chronic progression are more often fungal, tuberculous, PTLD, or nocardial infections. Subacutedisease with diffuse peribronchovascular or miliary abnormalities may be seen with viruses, nontuberculous mycobacteria, PCP, or graft rejection in lung allografts.Cavitation suggests angioinvasive disease caused by fungi, Nocardia, gram-negative bacilli, and embolic infection. Sirolimus toxicity may cause diffuse interstitialdisease often with superimposed infectious pneumonitis. Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia Epidemiology: The risk of infection with PCP is greatest in the ﬁrst 6 months after transplantation ( /C2510% of unprophylaxed recipients) and during periods of increasedimmunosuppression (169). Lung transplant recipients retainlifelong risk of PCP. PCP should be suspected with signiﬁcant hypoxemia out of proportion to subtle ﬁndings on chest examination and by radiography. The naturalreservoir of infection remains unknown. Aerosol transmission of infection has been demonstrated in animal models and clusters of infections have been describedamong immunocompromised hosts. Bolus corticosteroids, rapamycin lung syndrome, CMV, or community-acquired respiratory viral infection may precede PCP.Diagnosis: PCP is generally acute to subacute in development. PCP presents with a broad alveolar-arterial PO 2gradient, elevated serum lactic dehydrogenase (>300 IU/mL), and often elevated beta-1,3,glucan levels. No speciﬁc radiographic pattern exists for PCP. The chest radiograph may be normal or develop a pattern of perihilar and interstitial “ground glass” inﬁltrates with orwithout microabscesses, nodules, small effusions, orlymphadenopathy. Atypical Pneumocystis infection (radiographically or clinically) is seen in patients with coexisting pulmonary infections or who develop diseasewhile receiving prophylaxis with second-choice agents (e.g. pentamidine or atovaquone). The manifestations of PCP are virtually identical to those of CMV pneumoniaand these may coexist. Extrapulmonary disease is uncommon in the transplant recipient. Identiﬁcation of organisms in PCP should lead to successful treatment. Sputum induction with immunostaining should reveal organisms; otherwise, invasive techniques should beused and alternative diagnoses considered. The burden oforganisms in acquired immunodeﬁciency syndrome patients with PCP is generally greater than in transplanta- tion. Antibody staining reveals both cysts and trophozoites.The cyst wall can be displayed by a variety of staining tech- niques; the Gomori methenamine-silver nitrate method (which stains organisms brown or black) is most consis-tent. Sporozoites and trophozoites are stained by poly- chrome stains including Giemsa stains, but organisms are harder to visualize. Molecular assays are a useful adjunct todiagnosis (170,171). Therapy: Early therapy, ideally with TMP-SMZ, is preferred; few transplant patients tolerate full-dose TMP- SMZ for prolonged periods of time. Recommended treatment dosing (15 –20 mg/kg per day of the trimethoprim component) is often excessive. Creatinine may rise due tocompetition with trimethoprim for renal excretion and renal toxicity of sulfa. Hydration is essential. Alternate therapies are less desirable including atovaquone, clindamycin withprimaquine or pyrimethamine, or intravenous pentamidine. The use of short courses of adjunctive steroids with a gradual taper and treatment of concomitant CMV infections are useful in transplant recipients (169). Prophylaxis using low-dose TMP-SMZ is well tolerated, and allergies and toxicities are overestimated in the absence of history of true allergy or interstitial nephritis (Table 7). Alternative prophylactic strategies includingdapsone, atovaquone, and inhaled or intravenous pen-tamidine are less effective than TMP-SMZ. The advan- tages of TMP-SMZ include increased efﬁcacy, lower cost, multiple oral preparations, and possible protectionagainst other organisms including Toxoplasma ,Isospora , Cyclospora , and Nocardia species, and common urinary, respiratory, and gastrointestinal bacterial pathogens(169). 874 American Journal of Transplantation 2017; 17: 856–879Fishman  16006143, 2017, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajt.14208 by Cochrane Germany, Wiley Online Library on [07/12/2023].

Banff conference for allograft pathology was held in conjunction with the  annual meeting of the American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics  in Pittsburgh, PA (USA) and focused on refining recent updates to the classification,  advances from the Banff working groups, and standardization of molecular diagnos - tics. This report on kidney transplant pathology details clarifications and refinements  to the criteria for chronic active (CA) T cell–mediated rejection (TCMR), borderline,  and antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR). The main focus of kidney sessions was on how to address biopsies meeting criteria for CA TCMR plus borderline or acute  TCMR. Recent studies on the clinical impact of borderline infiltrates were also pre - sented to clarify whether the threshold for interstitial inflammation in diagnosis of  borderline should be i0 or i1. Sessions on ABMR focused on biopsies showing micro - vascular inflammation in the absence of C4d staining or detectable donor-specific antibodies; the potential value of molecular diagnostics in such cases and recommen - dations for use of the latter in the setting of solid organ transplantation are presented  in the accompanying meeting report. Finally, several speakers discussed the capabili - ties of artificial intelligence and the potential for use of machine learning algorithms  in diagnosis and personalized therapeutics in solid organ transplantation.

Banff Conference for Allograft Pathology was held September 23-27, 2019, in Pittsburgh, PA (USA), in conjunction with the Annual Meeting of the American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics (ASHI). A total of 1253 delegates from 31 countries attended the conference, including pathologists, immunol - ogists, physicians, surgeons, and immunogeneticists as well as rep - resentatives from industry. The focus of kidney sessions at the 2019 conference was to clarify diagnostic criteria for antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR) and chronic active (CA) T cell–mediated rejection (TCMR) to harmonize the pathologic diagnosis and consequent therapeutic strategies. In addition, consensus of the diagnosis of borderline (suspicious) for acute TCMR was reached. The current lit - erature on biomarkers and molecular transplant diagnostics was also reviewed, and recommendations of the Banff Molecular Diagnostics Working Group regarding clinical validation and adoption of the latter into the Banff classification will be presented in a separate meeting report. Continuing a theme from the Banff 2015 meeting, 1  results of studies using artificial intelligence (AI) and integrative epi - demiological approaches were presented. Their applicability in pre-diction, prognostication, and clinical trials could change standards of   16006143, 2020, 9, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajt.15898 by Cochrane Germany, Wiley Online Library on [07/12/2023].

Precise detec - tion and characterization of anti-HLA or non-HLA donor-specific an - tibodies (DSAs) was also revisited. This report summarizes the main outcomes of the Banff 2019 kidney sessions and their impact on the Banff classification. 2 |  UPDATES FROM THE BANFF WORKING  GROUPS The current active and new Banff working groups (BWGs) and their aims, leaders, and progress are listed in Table 1. One new BWG has  been formed, the Digital Pathology BWG. The aim of this working group is to define standards for digital pathology in the context of Banff lesion scores in order to standardize diagnostic scoring and reduce inter-observer variability. In addition, the peritubular capil - laritis (ptc) BWG has been reactivated. Recent studies have shown diagnostic and prognostic relevance of reporting the extent of cap - illaritis (diffuse vs focal) in addition to the Banff ptc score, in dif - ferent clinical scenarios including ABMR, mixed ABMR/TCMR, and low-grade microvascular inflammation (MVI). 3,4 The aim of the BWG  is to validate these findings in a multicenter study, and to evaluate optimal diagnostic thresholds. At its meeting during Banff 2019, the electron microscopy (EM)  BWG expanded on its previous recommendations 1,5 and agreed to  guidelines for tissue sampling and performing EM analysis for as - sessment of cg1a and peritubular capillary basement membrane multilayering (PTCML). These are summarized in Table 2. The group  also recommended the use of specific terminology aligned where possible with ongoing work of the Renal Pathology Society work - ing group developing consensus definitions for individual glomeru - lar lesions by light microscopy and EM. As specified in Table 3, this  includes the following, representing individual components of very early lesions of transplant glomerulopathy (cg1a): endothelial cell en - largement, subendothelial electron-lucent widening , and subendothelial  neo-densa glomerular basement membrane . Reporting of other endo - thelial and basement membrane features in glomeruli and peritubu - lar capillaries (PTCs) is left to the discretion of the pathologist as there are few data to support their use at present. Based on consen - sus opinion within the EM BWG, abbreviation for peritubular capil - lary basement membrane multilayering is recommended as PTCML. At the 2019 conference, final data from the BWG on the clas - sification of polyomavirus nephropathy (PVN) were presented. This BWG studied 192 patients with definitive PVN and identified two histologic markers predictive for graft function and graft survival: the Banff interstitial fibrosis (ci) score and a new score termed “the intra - renal polyomavirus load level” or pvl, the latter based on the fraction of tubules with evidence of PV replication by light microscopy OR immunohistochemical staining of epithelial cell nuclei for SV40 large T antigen (pvl1  ≤ 1%, pvl2  > 1%, and <10%, pvl3  ≥ 10%). The pvl and  ci scores were used to define 3 PVN classes (Tables 4 and 5). 6 3 |  CLARIFICATION AND UPDATES  TO THE BANFF 2017 CLASSIFICATION  REVISIONS The Banff 2019 kidney sessions focused on reviewing the impact of  the changes to the diagnostic criteria for both TCMR and ABMR that were made at the 2017 Banff conference. 5 For TCMR, this involved  mainly the implementation of CA TCMR: The extent to which this cat - egory is being used at different centers around the world, potential confusion regarding the wording of diagnoses within this category, how frequently patients with CA TCMR were being treated, and the efficacy of those treatments. The threshold for the interstitial inflam - mation score (i) in the diagnosis of borderline for acute TCMR, which has not been applied uniformly by different pathologists 7 and been  the subject of recent investigation8,9 was also discussed. For ABMR,  discussions centered around potential simplification of the diagnos - tic criteria, including clarifying the description of activity and chro-nicity components within the category of CA ABMR—making the resultant report more intelligible and useful to treating clinicians. 10  Standardized reporting for TCMR and ABMR diagnoses were dis - cussed, including the inclusion of individual Banff acute and chronic scores (i, t, g, cg, and so on) used in determining the subtype, activ - ity. and chronicity and explanations of these scores. 1,7 The clinical  implications of MVI in the absence of (DSAs with and without C4d deposition were also presented). Final consensus recommendations were aided by questionnaires distributed to pathologists, nephrolo - gists, and transplant surgeons attending the 2 kidney-specific ses - sions during and immediately after the meeting (Table 6). 3.1  | Chronic active TCMR criteria clarifications To assess whether transplant centers worldwide were applying the 2017 Banff classification and diagnosing CA TCMR, we en - listed the assistance of The Transplantation Society (TTS) and the CyberNephrology online forum (Dr Kim Solez) in circulating a sur - vey that was answered by 128 TTS members, including clinicians and pathologists, from six different continents before the meet - ing (Figure 1). Notably, pathologists at ~90% of surveyed centers  diagnosed CA TCMR, and at >80% of these centers at least some patients with this diagnosis were treated with steroids or other im - munosuppressive agents. However, those clinicians that do not rou - tinely treat patients with CA TCMR (52/81, 64%) indicated a need for more definitive data on the efficacy of CA TCMR treatment, and a minority (22/81, 27%) felt that the risk of treatment outweighs the benefits. Two points that should be emphasized regarding CA TCMR are that inflammation in areas of the cortex with interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (i-IFTA), while an essential component of CA TCMR, are not sufficient to make this diagnosis, which also requires   16006143, 2020, 9, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajt.15898 by Cochrane Germany, Wiley Online Library on [07/12/2023].

RandhawaIntegration of i-IFTA into classification;  reevaluate thresholds for i and t and possible addition of other findings (eg, edema) to TCMR diagnostic criteriaA multicenter clinicopathologic study aimed at addressing the  listed issues is in progress. To date biopsies and accompanying clinical data from 154 patients with “pure” (no ABMR) acute TCMR/borderline, 18 with chronic active TCMR, 55 with no rejection. and 31 patients with stable graft function (not biopsied) have been accrued into the study cohort. Data analysis and slide review have commenced, but more cases, especially cases of chronic active TCMR and control cases with complete clinical data for statistical analysis of TCMR/borderline thresholds, are required. These cases need to have documented absence of DSA and sufficient follow-up in addition to detailed clinical information. Sensitized L. CornellR. Sapir- Pichhadze E. KrausS. BagnascoC. SchinstockD. DadhaniaDefine criteria for highly sensitized patients  (HS), determine consensus for what personnel and facilities are needed for centers to perform transplantation in HS recipients, standardize the definitions related to management of sensitized transplant recipients. Evaluate current practices of centers performing renal transplants in sensitized recipients. Evaluate how clinicians interpret and apply Banff nomenclature, and recommend changes to wording of classification to optimize the use of Banff data in clinical care of HS patients.Survey regarding clinical practice related to highly sensitized  (HS) patients indicates that clinicians often fail to recognize chronic elements of ABMR (eg, cg > 0) and are more likely to consider a diagnosis of chronic active ABMR if C4d is negative, even if there is no TG, PTCML, or IFTA. The term “acute” is confusing in ABMR, and consequently it was removed from the Banff ABMR classification in 2017. 3 Further improved  communication between pathologists and clinicians regarding reporting of biopsy findings in HS. Follow-up preliminary survey results indicate that pathologists and clinicians have similar concerns about biopsy reporting of antibody-mediated injury: Banff classification is complex, changes frequently, and does not reflect the entire ABMR disease spectrum. Comprehensive literature review is in progress to outline patient risk spectrum with respect to antibody and to standardize definitions of incompatible transplants. Molecular  diagnosticsM. MengelR.

Development of an open source data sharing platform to exchange results from studies using the B-HOT panel and to allow multicenter and multiorgan validation of clinical utility of molecular diagnostics in transplant biopsies. Details given in a separate meeting report. HIV +/HIV+ renal  transplantsS. Bagnasco Compare kidney transplants from HIV+  and HIV-negative donors to HIV+ recipients with regard to graft function and graft survival, · incidence, type and pathologic features of allograft lesions including rejection, recurrent and de novo HIV-related/-unrelated renal disease; injury associated with antiretroviral and immunosuppressive treatment.Based on preliminary data from the pilot phase of the US  HOPE prospective multicenter trial for HIV+ to HIV+ kidney transplantation, TCMR is predominant, rejection appears to be unrelated to donor HIV status and may possibly be related to the type of immunosuppression. Additional data will become available with ongoing trial enrollment in upcoming years. The results of protocol/indication biopsies (archived as digital images), combined with comprehensive clinical information will be analyzed to expand these preliminary observations. Electron  microscopy (EM)C. RoufosseH. K SinghRecommendations for the sampling and  processing of tissue for EM and reporting of EM findings in transplant biopsies. Harmonize terminology with a list of definitions for cg1a and PTCML.

Results of initial survey of interobserver variability were poor (presented at Banff 2017); a new comprehensive teaching module will focus on the most problematic lesions gleaned from the 2017 survey; Goal is to improve the uniform use of currently published criteria and the inter-observer variability. Research proposal presented at Banff 2019: pilot test case data collection in 2020; final study design to be agreed upon before initiation of the full study in 2020-21. Goal is the multicenter validation of ultrastructural features through correlation with outcomes.

Determine the frequency with which TMA occurs in renal allograft biopsy specimens. Determine if there are specific features of TMA in renal allografts that help resolve the differential diagnosis of the TMA when the cause is not readily apparent from clinical history, DSA, C4d, etcUsing Delphi methodology, two phases were designed: Phase  I (with pathologists) and Phase II (with clinicians). Phase I (6/9 rounds completed) involving 23 centers; 1. We collected 37 transplant biopsies, and after 6 Delphi rounds, narrowed down 331 criteria to 61; 2. We classified the criteria into 4 classes (Pathology, Clinical, Laboratory and Differential Diagnosis) and 12 categories reflecting positive and negative criteria for LM, IF, EM, clinical, laboratory and genetic criteria; 3. Participants validated the 37 cases in 2 validation rounds. Results showed that 75% of the participants reached consensus in over 75% of cases, using the 61 criteria. 4. We identified the reasons for over- and under-diagnosis of TMA. Results of rounds 7, 8 and 9 are pending. Phase II: Recruitment of participants for the clinical Delphi starting January 2020. Future efforts will focus on completing the 3 remaining Delphi rounds (Phase I), soliciting nephrologists’ input (Phase II), combining Phase I and II results, dissecting diagnostic issues that emerged during Phase I, such as ABMR mimicking TMA and completing the  molecular studies to generate the final consensus guidelines.  The WG also plans to collaborate with groups that are working on native kidney TMA to compare results and generate a consensus document. Recurrent  glomerular diseaseN. AlachkarS. BagnascoEstablish pathologic guidelines for early  recurrence of glomerular diseases, including FSGS, IgA nephropathy, membranous nephropathy, MPGN/C3GN. What are frequencies, clinical manifestations, and pathologic characteristics of recurrent/de novo glomerular diseases, and can any of these predict recurrence and/or graft outcomes? Understand the pathologic changes of recurrent glomerular diseases occurring concurrently with rejection and other transplant-associated lesions.Biopsy specimens and clinical data are now being collected  from 10 international centers. Preliminary results confirm IgA nephropathy and FSGS as the most prevalent recurrent diseases. Combine all data to create a posttransplant GN registry. Future directions: • Correlate GN findings with Banff classification • Correlate pathology with biomarkers, DSA, etc • Determine if outcomes of posttransplant GN can be improved with early detection, prevention and therapy. Are there clinical and/or pathologic features of the native disease that predict likelihood of recurrence? Are there clinical and/or pathologic features of the recurrent disease in the allograft that predict graft loss? Which pathologic analyses are needed for optimal and early  diagnosis of recurrent disease? Is the apparent association of recurrent glomerular disease with acute rejection related to biopsy bias (ie incidental discovery of recurrent disease in biopsies done to rule out rejection), under-immunosuppression, or both? Surrogate  endpointsA. LoupyM. NaesensDefine valid surrogate endpoints and  invasive or noninvasive biomarkers for clinical trials and how histology and lesions related to tissue injury or scarring have to be integrated in such systems.

     |  2323 LOUPY et aL. (1) at least a moderate degree of total cortical inflammation and (2)  moderate tubulitis involving cortical tubules other than severely atrophic tubules (Table 4). i-IFTA itself is not a specific lesion and is  seen in the context of tissue injury due to many causes other than TCMR, including BK virus nephropathy and ABMR. 11 According to  Banff 2017,5 the tubulitis allowed for the diagnosis of CA TCMR may  be within or outside of scarred areas. However, for clarity and future investigation we suggest that tubulitis be independently scored (pro - viding that severely atrophic tubules are not scored) both in areas of preserved cortex (Banff t score) and within (Banff t-IFTA score) areas of cortical IFTA, as defined in Table 5. This may enable investiga - tors and clinicians to determine the impact on treatment response and graft survival of these different forms of tubulitis. An important concern expressed by some clinicians and pathologists is that the Banff 2017 diagnosis of CA TCMR does not discriminate between cases where all or nearly all inflammation is limited to i-IFTA vs those instances where coexistent i-IFTA and inflammation within non - scarred areas meets criteria for additional borderline acute TCMR or acute TCMR grade IA or IB diagnoses. Questionnaire responses from meeting attendees clearly replied that reporting of “mixed” CA TCMR with grade IA or IB acute TCMR could be improved by indicating separately when biopsies simultaneously met criteria for borderline for acute TCMR or acute TCMR grade IA or IB (Table 6).  Likewise, participants agreed that when intimal arteritis was present in addition to CA TCMR, this should also be specifically reported as a separate reported diagnosis. These suggestions pertain only to CA TCMR reporting and the actual histologic criteria for this diag - nosis remain unchanged (Tables 4 and 5). Nankivell et al 12 reported  that both development of i-IFTA and clearance of inflammation from scarred areas were dependent of the efficacy of immunosuppressive therapy. These data support the 2017 Banff criteria for CA TCMR, but also favor indicating the level of active inflammation in non - scarred cortex. 3.2 | Borderline (suspicious) for acute TCMR criteria  clarifications The Banff ’97 criteria for diagnosis of borderline for acute  TCMR required inflammation in at least 10% of nonscarred cor - tex (Banff i1) in addition to tubulitis.13 However, subsequent  iterations of the Banff classification (1) accepted tubulitis with minimal inflammation (isolated t; i0 t > 0) as sufficient for a di - agnosis of borderline, and a recent survey showed variability among pathologists with regard to which threshold was used for this diagnosis. 7 More recently, longitudinal studies of Nankivell  et al9 showed no effect of isolated t lesions on graft outcomes,  concluding that the original Banff ’97 threshold for borderline lesions should be applied, and 82% (57/69) of pathologists and clinicians (nephrologists and transplant surgeons) responding to the questionnaire distributed at the 2019 Banff conference agreed (Table 6). Consensus was therefore achieved that the di - agnostic threshold for borderline for acute TCMR should read as follows: “interstitial inflammation involving 10%-25% of non - sclerotic cortex (Banff i1) with at least mild tubulitis (t  > 0).” The  minimum lesion for a borderline diagnosis is thus i1t1. As with previous versions of the Banff classification, 1,13 lesions charac - terized by mild tubulitis (Banff t1) with inflammation involving >25% of nonsclerotic cortex (Banff i2/3) and no intimal arteritis are also included in the borderline category (Table 4).

2324  |     LOUPY et aL. biopsies with tubulitis (t  > 0) but without inflammation in at least  10% of nonsclerotic cortex (i0) are no longer included in this cat - egory, and neither are cases with inflammation in the absence of  tubulitis (i  > 0, t0). These are simply reported in the microscopic  description of the biopsy. 3.3 | ABMR criteria clarifications Since the introduction of ABMR into the Banff classification in 2003, 14 the criteria for diagnosis of ABMR have become more  complex, with major modifications in 201315 a n d  2 0 1 7 ,5 which  have improved diagnostic sensitivity and predictive value for graft outcomes. 16 A major residual issue within the classification is that  it still subclassifies ABMR into active or chronic active and chronic inactive (ie, transplant glomerulopathy without MVI and with cur - rent or historic DSA; Table  4) subtypes as opposed to representing  the diverse morphologic and molecular lesions at different post - transplant time points in antibody-mediated tissue injury. 17,18 In  particular, the category of CA ABMR encompasses lesions with severe activity and mild chronicity (eg, g3 ptc3 cg1 ci0 ct0 C4d3), those with mild activity and severe chronicity (eg, g1 ptc1 cg3 ci3 ct3 C4d0), and intermediate cases. Thus a simple diagnosis of CA ABMR gives treating clinicians limited information for appropri - ate treatment options. Although the addition of individual Banff lesion scores to the diagnostic line of the report is interpretable by experienced clinicians, it may confuse some clinicians who are unfamiliar with subtleties of the Banff system. This concern was highlighted by the recent work from the BWG on highly sensitized patients who found that the classification was interpreted in a highly variable way with implications for resultant therapeutic de - cision making. 10,19 Potential improvements in the wording of the  pathologic diagnoses in standard reports were discussed, which remained within the context of Banff 2017 to optimally convey the activity and chronicity levels of CA ABMR cases. For example, in lupus nephritis, 20 the previous designations of active (A), active  and chronic (A/C), and chronic (C) were replaced with a revised TABLE 2 Banff recommendations for electron microscopy in  renal transplant biopsies Recommendations for taking of a sample for EM Take a sample in all cases if possible, fixed and embedded as a resin  block. At a minimum, this should be done if there is any suspicion  of glomerular disease. While EM can be performed on samples recovered from paraffin blocks or frozen tissue to examine for electron dense deposits and to some extent the degree of foot process effacement, this is not recommended for assessment of glomerular basement membrane (GBM) thickness, cg1a or PTCML. In all cases, light microscopic (LM) examination of semi-thin stained sections should be performed. Recommendations for performing ultrastructural analysis Recommended in cases with: (a) Clinical, light microscopic and/or  immunohistochemical suspicion of glomerular disease or of other  diseases where EM may assist in diagnosis; (b) Patients at risk for antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR): patients who are sensitized, have documented DSA at any time posttransplant, and/or who have had a prior biopsy showing features of ABMR (C4d staining, glomerulitis and/or peritubular capillaritis). EM can also be useful: (a) To detect early recurrence in patients with  biopsy-proven glomerular disease as the cause of native kidney failure; (b) In for-cause biopsies ≥3 mo posttransplant, and in all biopsies ≥6 mo posttransplant, to determine if early changes of transplant glomerulopathy (cg1a) are present, prompting testing for DSA. In all cases, undertake an assessment for glomerular disease as in a  native renal biopsy. If performing EM in the setting of possible ABMR, assess for cg1a  and PTCML as recommended below. Recommendations for preparing the block for ultrastructural  examination Select an area in the resin block(s) of viable (non-necrotic) cortex,  preferentially with minimal tubular atrophy/interstitial fibrosis. Aim to include ≥2 full glomeruli (at least 1). Do not taper the block to a “cone” or “pyramid” by removing cortical tissue around the glomeruli and aim to have at least 10 peritubular capillaries (PTCs) for examination. Guidelines for ultrastructural assessment and reporting of cg1a Exclude globally or partly sclerosed glomeruli, and severely ischemic  glomeruli. Examine 1 complete glomerulus as a minimum; where possible  examine 2 or more. Examine the capillary loops at high magnification (≥5000x).cg1a is defined as: (a) No GBM double contours on LM; (b)  ≥3 capillary loops (in a single glomerulus) each showing: subendothelial neo-densa glomerular basement membrane (circumferential or not, single or multiple layers) AND  endothelial  cell enlargement and/or subendothelial electron-lucent widening. The report should state how many glomeruli were examined, and  how many loops show cg1a. Guidelines for ultrastructural assessment and reporting of PTCML Assess for PTCML in the cortical peritubular capillaries between the  glomeruli. Exclude scarred cortex and necrotic or hemorrhagic areas. Examine at least 10 PTC at high magnification (≥ 5000×).Count layers of basement membrane (BM) in the 3 worst affected  PTCs, for each counting in the PTC segment with the most layers (worst affected area along the circumference). The report should state the number of PTC examined; the number  of BM layers in the most affected PTC; and whether the Banff 2013 threshold for chronic ABMR (ptcml1; 1 PTC with ≥7 layers +2 PTC with ≥5 layers) is met.TABLE 3 Definitions of the individual components of early  lesions of transplant glomerulopathy • Endothelial cell enlargement is defined as glomerular endothelial  enlargement with associated increase in cytoplasm, decrease in the capillary luminal area and loss of fenestrations. This should be used rather than less precise or incorrect terminology such “endothelial swelling”, “reactive endothelial changes”, “endothelial activation”, “endothelial injury” or “endothelial cell degeneration”. • Subendothelial electron-lucent widening is defined as expansion of space between the glomerular endothelium and lamina densa of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) by electron-lucent material. This should be used instead of “lamina rara interna expansion” or “subendothelial rarefaction”. • Subendothelial neo-densa glomerular basement membrane is defined as circumferential or discontinuous, single or multiple basement membrane layer(s) clearly distinct from the original GBM.  16006143, 2020, 9, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajt.15898 by Cochrane Germany, Wiley Online Library on [07/12/2023].

However, the appli - cability of this approach to transplantation remains to be validated. Questionnaire respondents were also asked to select the optimal wording of the current Banff 2017 ABMR diagnosis from several options detailing activity and chronicity information, and how to best incorporate relevant Banff lesion scores into the final report. The option preferred by 56% of respondents was to word the di - agnosis line as follows: “(chronic) active ABMR with [mild, moder - ate, severe] activity and [mild, moderate, severe] chronicity” and include the Banff lesion scores in the text of the diagnostic line for the biopsy report or in a table (eg, Tables 5 and 6). However, the  definitions and optimal thresholds for mild, moderate, and severe still need to be validated in future studies, and as such, it remains at the discretion of individual pathologists whether to adopt such wording at this time or simply provide the Banff lesion scores. It should also be emphasized that these suggestions pertain only to the CA ABMR reporting language, and the actual histologic crite - ria for diagnosis of CA ABMR, as specified in Banff 2017, remain unchanged. 5 3.4 | Microvascular inflammation in the absence of  detectable DSAs At the Banff 2017 conference, updates to the ABMR classification  were made to help with decision-making in cases where a biopsy showed at least moderate MVI ((g + ptc) >2) but no detectable anti - bodies against the graft. 5 However, there are considerable numbers  of biopsies with (g + ptc) >2 in the absence of detectable anti-HLA  DSAs or C4d, and with molecular ABMR testing not widely adopted at this point, the clinical implications of these findings remain unclear. Recent evidence has suggested that patients with MVI on biopsies performed early posttransplant in the absence of DSAs had signifi - cantly better graft survival than those with anti-HLA DSAs (mainly low-level, preexisting DSAs), regardless of the presence or absence of PTC C4d staining on the biopsy. 21 DSA+ patients were more fre - quently retransplant recipients and had C4d+ biopsies. By contrast, studies of patients biopsied much later with more severe MVI and frequent transplant glomerulopathy (TG) showed no difference in graft survival in the presence or absence of anti-HLA DSAs, which in these studies were de novo DSAs. 22,23 Thus, at this point, we are  unable to draw significant conclusions regarding the significance of biopsies showing (g + ptc >2) in the absence of anti-HLA DSAs,  other than to comment that the biological behavior of such changes may well differ depending on whether these are seen relatively early posttransplant at a time when many DSAs represent persistent or recurrent/memory DSAs vs those seen later when most DSAs de - tected are de novo DSAs. In addition, the differential diagnosis of MVI with negative DSA and negative C4d should include T cell–me-diated endothelial injury (ptc), membranoproliferative glomerulone - phritis (g), and thrombotic microangiopathy (g). Furthermore, it has been shown recently in large populations that non-HLA antibodies could be independently associated with risk of allograft loss. 24 These  findings emphasize the importance of testing for clinically relevant non-HLA antibodies in patients with biopsies showing MVI. It is also hoped that implementation of molecular diagnostics could  help classifying these cases in a more pathogenesis-driven way, either employing the Molecular Microscope  Diagnostic System (MMDx) 25 or  the NanoString platform that can be used with formalin-fixed, paraf - fin-embedded tissue,26 providing greater insight into factors predictive  of the biological behavior of MVI without detectable anti-HLA DSAs, as well as cases with C4d staining without MVI. 27 Current recommen - dations of the Banff Molecular Diagnostics Working Group in these and other circumstances are detailed in a separate meeting report. Presently, however, available data do not warrant making changes to the ABMR classification specifically relevant to these cases, beyond those made in Banff 2017. 5 4 |  ROLE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE,  DATA INTEGRATION, AND MACHINE  LEARNING IN THE BANFF CLASSIFICATION During the 2019 Banff meeting, many projects using artificial intelli - gence (AI), machine learning (ML), as well as deep learning (DL) were  presented, with a heavy focus on applying the Banff classification in an automated fashion, clustering of patients, and digital pathology. However, the field is still poorly understood by most clinicians and pa - thologists. Several speakers at the 2019 Banff meeting discussed the capabilities of AI and the potential for use of ML algorithms in diagnosis and personalized medication in organ transplantation (Table 7). Computer-assisted digital pathology consists of analyzing whole  slide digital images of biopsies by a machine, and remains a challenge aIndividual Banff lesion scores are defined in Table 5, and it is  recommended that these be included in the biopsy report.  bIt should be noted that these arterial lesions may be indicative of  ABMR, TCMR, or mixed ABMR/TCMR. “v” lesions and chronic allograft  arteriopathy are only scored in arteries having a continuous media with ≥2 smooth muscle layers.  cThe clinical significance of these findings may be quite different in  grafts exposed to anti–blood group antibodies (ABO-incompatible allografts), where they do not appear to be injurious to the graft and may represent accommodation. However, with anti-HLA antibodies, such lesions may progress to chronic ABMR, and more outcome data are needed.  dSeverely atrophic tubules are defined as having each of 3 features:  diameter <25% of unaffected or minimally affected tubules in the same biopsy, an undifferentiated-appearing, cuboidal or flattened epithelium, and pronounced wrinkling and/or thickening of the tubular basement membrane.  eIt was felt by the majority of Banff 2019 meeting attendees that  reporting of chronic active TCMR should be accompanied by a second diagnosis of borderline acute TCMR or acute TCMR (with appropriate grade) when criteria for both diagnoses are met.  fpvl scores are defined in Table 5 and in detail in ref. 4. An adequate  sample for such scoring should include 2 biopsies cores and contain medulla. PVN can coexist with ABMR or with TCMR grades 2 or 3.

At this point DL-based histopathologic  assessment of kidney tissue shows the ability to distinguish glom - eruli, proximal and distal tubules, and areas of fibrosis.28-30 The cur - rent approach is promising but still shows high variability and poor correlation with clinical outcomes. A BWG on Digital Pathology has been formed at the 2019 Banff meeting to standardize scanning and analytical practices through facilitating studies focusing on IFTA and inflammation scoring while using algorithms fitting the most cur - rent Banff classification to decrease inter-observer variability. Because personalized medicine has been a major focus in recent years, utiliz - ing algorithms and archetype analysis has the potential to combine biopsy results with clinical and laboratory data and to provide a more complete pathologic and prognostic picture, especially in the era of expanding electronic medical records. 31 F urthermore,  A.  Loup y  pre - sented the capability of natural language processing (NLP) to help such algorithms assist clinicians and reduce human errors.

Patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment, for example, due to organ transplantation or autoimmune disease, are instructed to isolate at home because of a presumed higher risk of more seri - ous disease and possible death. COVID-19 is triggered by a novel coronavirus identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China and has been named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Two drugs have shown promising effect on COVID-19 patients. Remdesivir proved in a recent trial to reduce time to recovery but had no effect on mortality. 1 Dexamethasone has in a  preprint been shown to reduce 28-day mortality in a subgroup of patients. 2 Dexamethasone and remdesivir obviously target COVID- 19 differently, which highlights the complex pathogenesis of the disease. SARS-CoV-2 induces a variety of symptoms such as fever, myalgia, dry cough, loss of smell, and in some patients progresses to Received: 28 May 2020  | Revised: 6 July 2020  | Accepted: 27 July 2020 DOI: 10.1111/ajt.16250   MINIREVIEW Cyclosporine and COVID-19: Risk or favorable?

COVID-19 is triggered by a novel coronavirus: severe acute respiratory syn - drome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Baseline characteristics of admitted patients  with COVID-19 show that adiposity, diabetes, and hypertension are risk factors for developing severe disease, but so far immunosuppressed patients who are listed as  high-risk patients have not been more susceptible to severe COVID-19 than the rest  of the population. Multiple clinical trials are currently being conducted, which may identify more drugs that can lower mortality, morbidity, and burden on the society.  Several independent studies have convincingly shown that cyclosporine inhibit repli - cation of several different coronaviruses in vitro. The cyclosporine-analog alisporivir  has recently been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. These findings are intriguing,  although there is no clinical evidence for a protective effect to reduce the likelihood of  severe COVID-19 or to treat the immune storm or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that often causes severe morbidity. Here, we review the putative link between  COVID-19 and cyclosporine, while we await more robust clinical data.

2976  |    POULSEN Et aL. a more severe disease requiring admittance to intensive care units  (ICUs). The first clinical characteristics from China showed that a more severe disease outcome defined as need for ICU admittance or death was associated with the presence of comorbidities, par - ticularly diabetes, obesity, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease. 3-7 There exist only very limited data on  disease severity in transplanted patients treated with calcineurin inhibitors in combination with other drugs, such as prednisolone or mycophenolate mofetil. However, the first sparse available data indicate that transplanted patients have no increased risk of se - vere disease despite of multiple and diverse comorbidities. Li et al 8  report of 2 cases of COVID-19 in heart transplant recipients. One had severe disease and both patients recovered. In 2 heart trans - plant recipients with COVID-19 in the United States, 1 patient died from multiorgan failure and the other patient had mild disease and was discharged on day 8. 9 In 4 kidney transplant recipients from  Wuhan, China, it was stated that all patients benefited from re - duction of immunosuppressants, because all 4 patients had mild disease. 10 A 50-year-old COVID-19 patient in Spain, treated with  tacrolimus because of previous kidney transplantation, needed treatment in the ICU on day 12. 11 These early case reports have  now been supported by 3 cohort studies from transplanted patients in Europe. 12-14 In a study from Spain, 29 kidney transplant recipients  with COVID-19 were evaluated. One group of patients (n  = 6) were  reduced in calcineurin inhibitor dose and the second group (n = 23) either continued their usual cyclosporine dose or were switched from tacrolimus to cyclosporine. The first group had a mortality of 50% and the second group only 12.5%, thus supporting the idea that continuous use of cyclosporine might be beneficial in COVID-19 patients. However, the study is observational and not a blinded randomized clinical trial (RCT) and both groups were also treated with multiple non-protocolized drugs: two thirds of the patients were given high-dose steroid, one third were given intravenous immunoglobulin, one third an interleukin-6 (IL-6) inhibitor, and all patients were given hydroxychloroquine, thus making it difficult to draw definite clinically conclusions from these interesting observa - tions from Rodriguez-Cubillo et al. 15 The transplantation society currently recommends close at - tention to patients with medication-induced lymphopenia, but no specific instructions on antirejection regimen exist because of the current lack of evidence. 16 Romanelli et al17 have suggested that cli - nicians must consider pausing immunosuppressants in transplanted patients with COVID-19, which is a common strategy in transplanted patients with infections. This suggestion may in part be based on data from the epidemic of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) as some case reports of kidney transplant recipients infected with MERS died. 18,19 The aforementioned COVID-19 clinical observations may be  premature, but they all indicate that immunosuppression and use of calcineurin inhibitors impose no increased risk for severe disease, and we speculate that calcineurin inhibitors may protect from severe disease and ultimately death because transplanted patients often have a high prevalence of other risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. However, there may exist other explanations to why COVID-19 seems to be mitigated in transplant recipients, for example, that this patient group is particularly compliant with hy - giene recommendations and preventive measures. Another expla - nation could be the easier access to hospitals and thus increasing numbers of detected COVID-19 infected with mild symptoms, which would otherwise not be found in the general population thus diluting the case fatality rate. Computational methods looking into host–virus interactions and  possible antiviral drug targets with repurposed drugs suggest tacro - limus among others as a potential drug against COVID-19. 20,21 A let - ter by Russel et al suggests that there is tantalizing in vitro evidence for cyclosporine as an anti-coronavirus agent as well as a potential disease-modifying role through inhibition of severe acute respira - tory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus-mediated IL-2 induction and au - thors advocate that a trial of cyclosporine should be considered in the event of a future SARS epidemic. 22 These promising pilot data  require appropriate power in larger studies before immunosuppres - sion can be considered a low risk or maybe even protective for se - vere COVID-19 but here we review how cyclosporine may influence COVID-19. 2 |  COVID-19 Six coronaviruses have previously been shown to cause human disease but 4 of these are considered low pathogenic coronavi - ruses (229E, HKU1, OC43, and NL63) that causes mild upper res - piratory tract infections, 23 in contrast to the highly pathogenic  β-coronaviruses: SARS24,25 and MERS that both cause severe lower  airway infection and fatal viral pneumonia.23,26 Back in 2002-2003,  SARS infected more than 8000 causing at least 774 deaths with a case fatality rate of approximately 10%. MERS proved even more deadly causing around 2500 cases and approximately 900 deaths and a case fatality rate of approximately 35%. 6 Both SARS and MERS  have a broad spectrum of symptoms ranging from flulike symptoms to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 27 SARS-CoV-2 is also a β -coronavirus, it shares 79% homology  with SARS28,29 and has 96% sequence identity with bat coronavirus  (BatCoV RaTG13).29-31 To understand the pathogenesis of COVID-19  it is important to discriminate between the tissue damage induced by the pathogen and the indirect and later effects caused by the immune response, which on one hand is required in order to erad - icate the virus but also may induce significant organ damage. The main target for SARS-CoV-2 is the lungs like SARS. Severe pneu - monia develops and is often associated with massive inflammatory cell infiltration (lymphocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils) and elevated proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine responses resulting in acute lung injury and ARDS. 23 The incubation period of SARS- CoV-2 is typically 2-7 days32 before the patients present with fever,  cough, dyspnea, fatigue, and myalgia,4,32-34 which may be accompa - nied by rhinorrhoea, pharyngalgia, anosmia, ageusia, and diarrhea.6  The median age of hospitalized patients has been reported to be   16006143, 2020, 11, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajt.16250 by Cochrane Germany, Wiley Online Library on [07/12/2023].

   |  2977 POULSEN Et aL. around 49-63 years old in China.4,7,34-36 A remarkable high number  of patients below 70 years of age without significant comorbidi - ties are requiring admittance in the ICU with ventilator support,  with a median age of 61 years in the United Kingdom.37 A recent  study showed that of patients admitted to ICU 61.1% had ARDS, 44.4% had arrhythmia, and 30.6% had shock. 35 The high frequency  of ARDS may be the cause for admittance to ICU but other studies investigating hospitalized patients with no ICU admittance report ARDS in 17%-29% of all hospitalized patients 33,34 and a case fatality  rate of 3.6%-6.8%.33,38 Early data from China showed a mortality  rate of 11%-16% among hospitalized patients.4,7,34 The late but typi - cally abrupt onset of severe COVID-19 with hypoxemia and dyspnea requires hospital admission and some rapidly progressed to ARDS that eventually would lead to septic shock, metabolic acidosis, coag - ulation dysfunction, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. 6,32,35  It remains to be shown if these symptoms are similar or reduced in immunocompromised patients because of inhibition of the cytokine response as previously shown for parainfluenza virus. 39 Data from  21 solid organ transplant recipients from Switzerland showed almost similar clinical presentation; however, remarkably the severity and complication rates were not higher than in the general population with 19% developing ARDS, 9.5% died, and 23% needed ICU admis - sion. 13 Another Spanish study including 33 kidney transplant recipi - ents showed that 52% were admitted to ICU, 6% needed mechanical ventilation, and 6% died. 12 The study concluded that the severity  of COVID-19 was not different in immune compromised patients. Although these findings are in opposition to a small American cohort study reporting more severe outcome in transplant recipients with 34% ICU admission and 24% death of hospitalized cases. 40 Severity of COVID-19 is related to the onset of lower respira - tory tract disease and pneumonia that typically occur 7-10 days after onset. This seems slightly delayed compared with influenza virus pneumonia. 32,41,42 Lymphocytopenia has been suggested  to be a negative predictor of disease progression and prognosis, whereas newer data suggest that elevated D-dimer, C-reactive pro - tein, viral load, and low albumin are poor prognostic signs. None of these markers have been reproduced consistently and they all need to be validated in larger ongoing clinical trials. The most common finding on computed tomography scan was bilateral pneumonia and ground-glass opacities 33 that were associated with more severe dis - ease manifestations. Other radiological findings, such as interlob - ular septal thickening, pulmonary consolidations, and the so-called white lung due to atelectasis and pleural effusion, were also asso - ciated with severe COVID-19. 32,43 A comprehensive Chinese study  showed that older age and lower CD4-T-cell count were associated with ICU admission and ARDS, and highly elevated IL-6 levels in ICU patients were suggestive of a cytokine storm and an inappropri - ate host-inflammatory response in patients with severe disease. 36  Indeed, patients admitted to the ICU had higher levels of numerous cytokines when compared to patients not in the ICU. 4 It has been  speculated that the reason why children suffer from less severe disease during this pandemic is because of the role of the thymus gland and thus the difference in cytokine expression. 44 On the other hand, the overactive immune reaction may be due to impaired viral clearance again highlighting that appropriate immune system activ - ity is required at all times. Postmortem studies of COVID-19 patients showed diffuse alveolar damage, cellular fibromyxoid exudates, desquamation of pneumocytes, and hyaline membranes in the lung equivalent to ARDS. 45,46 They also report of a hyperactive state with  overactivated T cells and suggest that most of the lung injury seems to be caused by severe immune injury. 3 | CALCINEURIN INHIBITORS AND  CORONAVIRUS REPLICATION The outbreak of SARS, MERS, and now COVID-19 has demonstrated human vulnerability to coronavirus epidemics. Neither vaccines nor therapeutics are available against human or animal coronaviruses and most of the drugs used in ongoing clinical trials to treat COVID-19 have been selected because they repress coronavirus replication in vitro. One of the consequences of the SARS epidemic was an in - crease in efforts to understand coronavirus replication and identify additional possible targets for antiviral therapy including calcineu - rin. 47 Pfefferle et al investigated coronavirus-host interactions using  a genome-wide yeast-two hybrid screening and identified the coro - navirus nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp-1) and several immunophilins as important in virus-host response 48 and Luo et al49 report that the  nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV bind to cyclophilin A. Cyclosporine and tacrolimus are the most used calcineurin inhib - itors in daily clinical practice for prevention of alloimmune response in transplantation. 50,51 Both compounds suppress the immune sys - tem and the main action is prevention of interleukin-2 (IL-2) produc - tion in T cells.52 Cyclosporine and tacrolimus are chemically distinct  molecules that bind to the intracellular immunophilins cyclophi - lin52-55 and FK506 binding protein (FKBP)-12,56 respectively, and  this calcineurin-inhibitor-immunophilin complex inhibits the phos - phatase activity of calcineurin that regulates nuclear translocation and subsequent the activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). NFAT inhibition will eventually lead to the block of transcrip - tion of cytokines and thus inhibition of T cell activation 48,52-55,57-59  (Figure  1). Several independent studies have shown that coronavirus rep - lication and growth depend on active immunophilin pathways. This has been shown for several human coronaviruses including HCoV-NL63, 60,61 and HCoV-229E.62,63 However, studies silencing  specific immunophilins only show partial effect thus indicating a more complex mechanism of action. 53,64,65 The immunophilin path - way is inhibited by both tacrolimus and cyclosporine. Cyclosporine at noncytotoxic concentrations induces a strong inhibition of the replication of several coronaviruses including SARS-CoV 48,64 (EC50  3.3 µmol/L), MERS-CoV,66 and HCoV-229E in vitro.64 Cyclosporine  alone or in combination with interferon alpha also inhibit replication of MERS in human ex vivo explant cultures. 67 Tacrolimus in low non - cytotoxic concentrations inhibits the growth of numerous human coronaviruses including SARS-CoV (EC 50 6 . 9  µ m o l / L )  i n  v i t r o .60   16006143, 2020, 11, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajt.16250 by Cochrane Germany, Wiley Online Library on [07/12/2023].

Moreover, several cyclosporine and tacrolimus analogs, which are  pharmaceutical agents similar to either cyclosporine or tacrolimus but designed to lack the immunosuppressive effect, including the drug alisporivir, have demonstrated potent suppressive effects on replication of multiple coronaviruses in vitro such as SARS-CoV (EC 50  1.3-8.3  µmol/L),68 MERS-CoV (EC50 1.5-4.0  µmol/L),68 HCoV-NL63  (EC50 0.8  µmol/L),61 and HCoV-229E (EC50 1.37-2.77  µmol/L),62  and now 2 independent studies have found that alisporivir inhibits SARS-CoV-2 in vitro with EC 50 of 4.9  µmol/L69 and 0.46  µmol/L,70  respectively. Alisporivir was tested in vivo but was unable to dimin - ish morbidity or mortality in an in vivo mouse model, which high - lights that in vitro findings have a hard time being extrapolated to the clinical setting. 68 Noteworthy, cyclosporine and derivatives have  also in vivo been shown to be effective against other virus, such as influenza virus, 71 HIV, and hepatitis C virus, and usage in clinical  studies of hepatitis C-infected adults showed promising results72-75  but has not had any clinical implications and warrants further stud - ies. Still the in vivo effect and particularly clinical effects of calci - neurin inhibitors on SARS-CoV-2 have yet to be confirmed. The in vitro findings on coronavirus replication and beneficial  effects in other virus diseases in vivo are intriguing, but the obvious question is whether the dosage of cyclosporine required to attain efficient inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in the lungs is safe and tolera - ble. The cyclosporine concentration required to inhibit virus repli - cation exceeds by far the serum concentrations that typically are well below 200  ng/mL. 76-78 This implies that the dosage used to treat  most patients with cyclosporine is too low to effectively eradicate the virus. One of the challenges is to obtain sufficient tissue con - centration, as the main virus load is in the airways and lungs and not in serum and the concentration of cyclosporine in the lungs is lower than in serum. Moreover, the required dosage for actively treating patients with severe COVID-19 would be 3-6 fold higher, which in turn would cause severe adverse and possible toxic effects especially nephrotoxicity. 79,80 Moreover, the free available fraction  and particularly the local tissue concentration of cyclosporine in the lungs would be too low to induce a substantial inhibition of virus replication. Peak concentration in serum cyclosporine could in the - ory reach levels that approximate antiviral concentrations but the only way to reach high local tissue concentrations would be through cyclosporine inhalation. Inhaled cyclosporine has been tested in an - imals, 81 healthy volunteers, and lung transplant recipients82,83 and  the lung concentration of inhaled cyclosporine is 3 times higher than when systemically administered. 81 It is generally well tolerated, al - though a few cases of transient reduced forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) following inhalation have been reported. Inhaled cyclosporine is not available as routine treatment and can - not be advised at this moment for COVID-19 patients as there is no human in vivo proof of an antiviral effect. The Immunonephrology Working Group of the European Renal  Association–European Dialysis and Transplant Association has pub - lished recommendations for the management of patients with im - mune-mediated kidney disease during this current pandemic, and authors point out that patients with mild COVID-19 might continue low dose of cyclosporine because of the in vitro evidence of inhibition of coronavirus replication. 84 Moreover, a recent comment supports  the idea that cyclosporine might be the drug-of-choice during the COVID-19 pandemic for kidney transplant recipient because of the in vitro evidence and thus providing an “old” alternative to the routine rejection regimens. 85 However, rejection rates are higher in patients  on cyclosporine compared to tacrolimus in kidney,86 heart,87 and liver  transplant recipients.88 The defining evidence would be to investigate  cyclosporine treatment in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. There is reason to believe that it would be safe to treat this patient group with low dose cyclosporine (<3 mg/kg). Previous studies have shown that cyclosporine is safe to use in critically ill patients with severe in - fections, inflammatory diseases and even circulatory vulnerable pa - tients, and high-dose cyclosporine (4.5-8.3 mg/kg) is well tolerated in steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis. 89 Moreover, a meta-analysis  showed that cyclosporine had a beneficial effect on mortality for Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis 90 where  rapid onset of treatment response as in COVID-19 is warranted. In a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial cyclospo - rine improved lung function when given to severe asthma patients for 3  months and significantly lowered exacerbation rate compared  to the placebo group and was well tolerated in patients with severe asthma. 91 In a multicenter, double-blind, randomized trial of bolus FIGURE 1 Overview of the 2 most  commonly used calcineurin inhibitors and the possible effects on COVID-19.

   |  2979 POULSEN Et aL. injection of cyclosporine was tested in patients with an acute anterior  ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) who were un - dergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention. Cyclosporine did not result in improved clinical outcomes compared to placebo; however, interestingly, the authors did not find any significant dif - ference in the safety profile between the two treatment groups thus indicating that cyclosporine treatment in these circulatory unstable patients was well tolerated. 92 In a randomized controlled trial of cy - closporine plus intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment or IVIG alone to children with Kawasaki disease found that combined treat - ment with cyclosporine and IVIG reduced the incidence of coronary artery abnormalities. Authors report no difference of adverse effects in the 2 groups and concludes that cyclosporine treatment is safe and well tolerated. 93 This is of particular interest because of the ob - served increased incidence of Kawasaki disease during the COVID-19 pandemic. 94 One case report from Japan of a 1 0-year -old boy with  a mycoplasma pneumoniae lung abscess with laboratory indication of cytokine storm was treated with cyclosporine, which suppressed the hypercytokinemia. 95 Based on the presented findings, all of these  studies show that cyclosporine is safe to give to a broad range of criti - cal ill patients and we believe that it is safe to investigate cyclosporine in a placebo or dexamethasone controlled trial of COVID-19 patients requiring admittance to hospital. We cannot recommend switching antirejection regimen during  COVID-19, as the available data reviewed here are not sufficient to recommend replacing tacrolimus with cyclosporine during severe COVID-19. However, we do suggest that revised guidelines should recommend continuing cyclosporine to patients during COVID-19 except in cases of renal failure, severe leucopenia, or high serum cy - closporine levels. A switch from tacrolimus to cyclosporine would at this point be based purely on positive observational data with a putative benefit for COVID-19 morbidity but with a possible higher risk of rejection and we warrant controlled studies to test whether this switch is advisable or not. 4 | CONCLUSION Remdesivir and dexamethasone are the only drugs available with proven effect on COVID-19, although more efficient therapy is warranted and most patients are still only receiving supportive care including oxygen and empirical antibiotic therapy to prevent secondary infections. Currently, more than 200 new clinical tri - als are registered at clinicaltrials.org testing various treatments, for example, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, serine protease inhibitors, IL-6 inhibitors, Janus kinase (JAK)-inhibitors, interferons, antivirals, or azithromycin. To the best of our knowl - edge, no clinical controlled trial is being conducted to test the effect of any calcineurin inhibitor. Several groups have found in vitro evidence of cyclosporine mediated inhibition of replication of several coronaviruses including SARS and MERS and the cyclo - sporine-analog alisporivir inhibits SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Because of the limited number of patients and quickly contained SARS and MERS epidemics, these compounds have never been tested in a clinical setting before. We are still awaiting robust data from COVID-19 patients actively treated with calcineurin inhibitors due to transplantation or autoimmune disease but so far there is no evidence that use of cyclosporine possesses an additional risk for severe COVID-19 in addition to the comorbidities such as diabe - tes, smoking, hypertension, and obesity that often coexist in these patients. More controversial but not less intriguing is the puta - tive impact of cyclosporine on severe COVID-19, which ultimately should be tested in a RCT in hospitalized patients during this cur - rent pandemic to determine whether cyclosporine could reduce the need for ICU admittance and high oxygen demand.

Am J Transplant. 2021;21:4095–4097.    | 4095 AJT amjtransplant.comDOI: 10.1111/ajt.16735   LETTER TO THE EDITOR Organ transplantation from deceased donors with vaccine-   induced thrombosis and thrombocytopenia To the Editor: Vaccine-  induced thrombosis and thrombocytopenia (VITT) may  follow immunization with the ChAdOx1 nCoV-  19 vaccine against  SARS-  CoV-  2.1,2 Autoantibodies to platelet factor 4 (PF4) may me - diate VITT through antibody-  dependent platelet activation, though  the underlying etiology is uncertain.3 Anti-  PF4 antibodies are also  seen in heparin-  induced thrombocytopenia, though most cases  of VITT do not have prior heparin exposure. More than 20 million  people in the United Kingdom (UK) have received the ChAdOx1  nCoV-  19 vaccine. We carried out an early analysis of organ donation  and transplantation from UK donors with VITT, to understand the  implications of this emerging syndrome. Articles 6(1)(e) and 9(2)(h)  and (i) of the General Data Protection Regulations provide the basis  for NHSBT to use patient identifiable data without prior consent,  for the purposes of monitoring the safety of the national transplant  program. We identified 13 consented deceased organ donors, who pre - sented with thrombosis and/or hemorrhage and laboratory features  consistent with VITT,4 between 28 January and 9 April 2021. All had  received their first dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-  19 vaccine before admis - sion (see Table 1). Ten donors proceeded to donate 27 allografts to  26 recipients. After a median follow-  up of 19 days, 21 of 27 (78%) al - lografts have satisfactory function. Three recipients developed early  allograft failure requiring explantation (two livers and one kidney);  two transplanted kidneys have impaired allograft function, currently  requiring hemodialysis; and one recipient died within a day of trans - plantation from a presumed cardiac event. There were seven major  thrombotic or hemorrhagic postoperative complications (three  bleeds and four venous or arterial allograft thromboses) in six recip - ients, resulting in the loss of three transplants as described above;  these events occurred within 9 days of transplantation. Of the six re - cipients with bleeding or thrombotic events, two had received their  second dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-  19 vaccine within 30 days before  transplantation; neither patient had features suggestive of VITT at  the time of transplantation. Two of the three patients with bleeding  had preexisting risk factors for hemorrhage (dual antiplatelet agent  therapy, anticoagulation for metallic cardiac valve); none of the patients with thromboses had significant preexisting procoagulant  tendencies. So far, three liver recipients had detectable anti-  PF4 antibod - ies between 3 and 22 days posttransplant; one of these recipients  experienced a thrombotic complication without allograft loss and  the other two had uncomplicated postoperative courses. Ten re - cipients (six kidneys and four livers) tested negative for anti-  PF4  antibodies. The UK experience to date suggests that the potential risks of  transplanting organs from donors with VITT are twofold. First, early  major thrombosis or clinically significant bleeding, which may result  from preexisting hemostatic and endothelial dysfunction in the al - lograft. Second, possible transmission of pathogenic lymphocytes  producing anti-  PF4. The clinical significance of this is unclear; fur - ther follow-  up will determine whether this portends development of  VITT in the recipient. UK guidance has been drawn up for the selection, recovery, and  transplantation of organs from donors with VITT, as well as recipient  monitoring.5 We suggest that liver, lung, pancreas, and small bowel  transplants from donors with VITT should only proceed in urgent  situations, as these organs contain high numbers of “passenger”  donor lymphocytes. Since anti-  PF4 antibodies can provoke platelet  activation and thromboses, platelet transfusion should be avoided  during organ recovery and transplantation processes where possi - ble. The contribution of systemic heparinization during organ recov - ery to thrombosis within the allograft is uncertain, and argatroban  is an alternative anticoagulant.5 Current UK guidance recommends  that heparin can be used as per standard practice in the recipient  unless features of VITT develop.5 For recipients of organs from VITT  donors, monitoring of the platelet count, fibrinogen, D-  dimers, and  anti-  PF4 antibodies is essential.5 Further experience of organ transplantation from donors with  VITT and longer term recipient follow-  up will help guide clinical  decision-  making. In the meantime, transplantation of organs from  these donors should only proceed after careful consideration of the  methods for organ recovery and of the risks and benefits for a po - tential recipient, and an appropriate consent discussion.

There are no efficacy data available regarding these patients with any of the  available SARS-  CoV-  2 vaccines. We analyzed the humoral response following full vac - cination with the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-  BioNTech) in 136 kidney transplant recipients,  and compared it to 25 controls. In order to exclude prior exposure to the virus, only  participants with negative serology to SARS-  CoV-  2 nucleocapsid protein were in - cluded. All controls developed a positive response to spike protein, while only 51 of  136 transplant recipients (37.5%) had positive serology ( p < .001). Mean IgG anti-  spike  level was higher in the controls (31.05 [41.8] vs. 200.5 [65.1] AU/mL, study vs. control,  respectively, p < .001). Variables associated with null humoral response were older  age (odds ratio 1.66 [95% confidence interval 1.17–  2.69]), high-  dose corticosteroids  in the last 12 months (1.3 [1.09–  1.86]), maintenance with triple immunosuppression  (1.43 [1.06–  2.15]), and regimen that includes mycophenolate (1.47 [1.26–  2.27]). There  was a similar rate of side effects between controls and recipients, and no correlation  was found between the presence of symptoms and seroconversion. Our findings sug - gest that most kidney transplant recipients remain at high risk for COVID-  19 despite  vaccination. Further studies regarding possible measures to increase recipient's re- sponse to vaccination are required.

COVID-  19  in solid organ transplant recipients is associated with increased mor - bidity and mortality due to comorbidities and immunosuppression  state.1,2 
GRUPPER Et al.2720  |   AJT Based on data from other vaccinations, the immune response of  solid organ recipients to vaccination may be blunted,3 - 5 and an ade - quate vaccine response cannot be assumed. Transplant recipients were not enrolled in phase 3 studies of  SARS-  CoV-  2 vaccines,6,7 and currently no efficacy, immunogenic - ity, or safety data are available for this vulnerable population with  any of the approved COVID-  19 vaccines. Recently, in a study of 436  solid organ transplant recipients, the majority of participants did  not mount appreciable immune response following a single dose of  mRNA SARS-  CoV-  2 vaccine.8 The present study was aimed, for the first time to the best of  our knowledge, to quantify the humoral response following full  vaccination with the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-  BioNTech) SARS-  CoV-  2  vaccine, in a cohort of kidney transplant recipients, by determin - ing the level of antibodies directed against the S (spike) antigen,  comparing it to controls, and exploring the factors that may be  associated with it. In order to eliminate prior exposure to the virus  and evaluate the influence of the vaccine itself, only participants  with negative serology to SARS-  CoV-  2 nucleocapsid protein were  included. 2 | METHODS 2.1  |  Study design The study includes two cohorts: A study group, composed of adult  kidney transplant recipients who are routinely followed in our trans - plant center clinic and were in a routine visit during the study period.  The control group, composed of 25 health-  care workers (none of  them receiving immunosuppressive treatment) from our institution.  All the participants provided written informed consent. The patients were included if they have completed the full vac - cination and self-  reported of no positive polymerase chain reaction  (PCR) to SARS-  CoV-  2 before. All participants had been vaccinated  with the BNT162b2 SARS-  CoV- 2 (Pfizer-  BioNTech) vaccine, with the  recommended dosing interval of 21 days between the two doses.  The blood samples were collected between 10 and 20 days after the  second vaccine dose injection. Freshly collected blood in clot activator and gel tube was centri - fuged at 4500 rpm for 10 min. The sera were separated and stored  at 4°C for analysis. LIAISON SARS-  CoV-  2 S1/S2 IgG chemiluminescent assay  (DiaSorin S.p.A.) was used according to the manufacture instruc - tions, to detect IgG antibodies directed against a recombinant S  protein (S1/S2).9 S a m p l e s  d i s p l a y i n g  < 1 2 . 0  A U / m L  w e r e  c o n s i d - ered negative, those ranging between 12.0 and 15.0 AU/mL are  equivocal, and those >15 AU/mL were considered as positive. For  the purpose of the analysis, participants with equivocal response  (a total of two participants from the study group) were considered  as negative. In addition, in order to explore prior exposure to SARS-  CoV-  2,  every participant had a test to detect IgG antibodies directed against the SARS-  CoV-  2 nucleocapsid protein, performed with an Architect  i2000SR analyzer (Abbot Diagnostics) and Abbott chemistry accord - ing to the manufacture instructions. A cutoff of 1.4 index (S/C) was  used.10 Exclusion criteria included a history of prior positive PCR test for  SARS-  CoV-  2; detectable IgG antibodies for the SARS-  CoV-  2 nucleo - capsid protein; and individuals who were not fully vaccinated or had  less than 10 days following the second vaccine dose. Every participant was asked to report the side effects after each  dose of the vaccine (during 7 days following every dose). The side  effects were divided to local (pain, redness, swelling, and regional  lymphadenopathy) and systemic side effects (fever, chills, head - ache, fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea) and  ranked on a scale (0–  4). In our center the induction immunosuppression therapy consists  of antithymocyte globulin or basiliximab, according to patients’ risk of  rejection, in addition to methylprednisolone intravenously. We use a  maintenance regimen consisting of triple immunosuppression ther - apy including calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs; tacrolimus or cyclosporin),  mycophenolate mofetil or mycophenolate sodium (MMF), and low-  dose prednisone (5 mg/day). This is consistent with the 2009 Kidney  Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO)11 guideline for the  Care of Kidney Transplant Recipients. According to the patient's  risk stratification for rejection, side effects or other considerations,  the maintenance regimen may be intensified or reduced, including  changing doses or suspending specific agent, adding or switching to  mTOR inhibitors (everolimus or sirolimus) or azathioprine. Clinical and epidemiological data were obtained from the med - ical charts. We used the records on the maintenance immunosup - pression, as well as the baseline recorded laboratory tests that  were routinely taken during the last clinic visit prior the first dose  of vaccine and processed in the hospital central laboratory. Triple  immunosuppression was defined as any combination of three  different medications (including prednisone, CNIs, MMF, mTOR  inhibitors, or azathioprine). Treatment with high- dose cortico- steroids was defined as a pulse of methylprednisolone (≥125 mg),  or prednisone ≥40 mg/day. Low-  dose prednisone was defined as  5 mg/day. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using  MDRD formula12 and adjusted to body surface area (Mosteller cal - culation). Body mass index (BMI) was defined as dry weight in kilo - grams divided by height in square meters. The study was approved by the local ethical institutional review  board. 2.2  |  Statistical analysis Continuous variables were first tested for normal distribution using  the Kolmogorov–  Smirnov test and Q–  Q plots, and were summarized  and displayed as mean (standard deviation, SD) for normally distrib - uted variables, and as median (IQR, interquartile range) for nonnor - mally distributed variables.  16006143, 2021, 8, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajt.16615 by Cochrane Germany, Wiley Online Library on [07/12/2023].

GRUPPER Et al.   |  2721AJT Categorical variables were displayed as number of patients and  the percentage in each group. For all categorical variables, the chi-  square statistic was used to assess the statistical significance be - tween groups. Continuous variables were compared by using a t-  test  if normally distributed or by Kruskal–  Wallis/Mann–  Whitney test if  nonnormally distributed. Correlation between two continuous parameters was calcu - lated by Spearman analysis. In order to identify which variables are  affected by multicollinearity and the strength of the correlation, we  calculated variance inflation factors (VIF) and reported VIF above 3.  We fitted binary logistic regression models for the risk of negative  serology test including the significant variables that were found in  univariate analysis. p < .05 was considered statistically significant for all analyses.  IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 22 (IBM Corp.) was used  for all statistical analyses. 3 | RESULTS The control group was composed of 25 participants. One hun - dred thirty-  nine kidney transplant recipients were recruited  to the study group, three of them were excluded from further  analysis due to positive IgG antibodies to SARS-  CoV-  2 nucleocap - sid protein (all had a positive level of anti-  spike antibodies). All  participants in both cohorts were Caucasians. Kidney transplant  recipients were significantly older than the controls (age ranges  30– 78 and 22–  81 years, respectively), while female sex was more  prevalent in the control group. However, mean period of time  after administration of both vaccine doses was similar in both  groups (Table 1). The majority of recipients (125, 90%) were after kidney trans - plant, nine simultaneous kidney and pancreas transplant, two  kidney after liver transplant, and three after simultaneous kidney  and liver transplant. Ten recipients had at least two transplan - tations. Median time after first transplantation was 39.2 months  (IQR 18.4–  61.9 months, range 1.3–  404 months), and after last transplantation 38.0 months (IQR 18.4–  61.0, range 1.3–  313).  Twenty-  two patients were transplanted in the last 12 months  prior to vaccination, five of them in the last 3 months. Kidney  donation was from living donor in 61.7% (living related 39 [28.6%]  and living unrelated 45 [33%]). Four recipients received desensiti - zation treatment with rituximab in the last 12  months. Eighty-  six  recipients (64%) received induction with basiliximab and 47 re - cipients (34.5%) received induction with antithymocyte globulin,  18 of them within the last 24  months prior to SARS-  CoV-  2 vacci - nation. One patient had an acute cellular rejection in the last year  (5 days posttransplant, treated for the rejection with antithymo - cyte globulin and high-  dose corticosteroids). CNIs were used as the backbone of the immunosuppressive  regiment in 90.4% of the patients (tacrolimus in 121 and cyc - losporine in two patients). Prednisone was used in 121 (88.9%)  patients and MMF in 104 (76.4%). Most recipients (107, 78.6%)  were treated with a combination of three immunosuppressive  medications, most of them with prednisone, tacrolimus, and MMF  (81, 59.6%). Two recipients had a reduction in the maintenance  immunosuppression protocol in the 30 days prior to the vaccine  (suspending MMF treatment). Thirty-  six patients (26.5%) were transplanted preemptively  (without need for dialysis prior to kidney transplantation).  Comorbidities included ischemic heart disease in 48 recipients  (35%), hypertension in 105 (77%), diabetes mellitus in 59 (43%)  (16 of them had new-  onset diabetes after transplantation), and 6  had active malignancies other than nonmelanomatous skin cancer  (one renal cell carcinoma, one posttransplant lymphoproliferative  disease (PTLD), two prostate carcinoma and two Kaposi's sar - coma). Twenty-  six recipients (19%) had a BMI >30 kg/m2. 3.1  |  Side effects and adverse reactions after the  vaccine administration Unfortunately, one kidney transplant recipient, who had unde - tectable antibody levels after full vaccination, expired due to se - vere PCR-  proven COVID-  19, 9 weeks after the second dose of  vaccine. Currently, 12 weeks following the vaccine, another kid - ney recipient with undetectable antibody levels is hospitalized  with moderate PCR-  proven COVID-  19. There were no additional  cases of PCR-  confirmed SARS-  CoV-  2 infections in the time pe - riod of 1  week after the second dose of vaccine until now (April  12, 2021), nor were biopsy-  proven acute rejections, new neuro - logical diagnoses (Guillain- Barre syndrome, Bell's palsy or other  neuropathy), or severe allergic reactions in our cohorts. The most common side effect after the vaccine administra - tion was local pain, in 84 of 161 (52.2%) participants. Systemic  symptoms developed in 31 (19.2%) of participants. There was a  similar rate of symptoms between seropositive and seronega - tive individuals, as well as between controls and recipients. No  correlation was found between the presence of side effects and  seropositivity.TABLE 1  Characteristics of kidney transplant recipients and  control group who received the Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine FactorKidney transplant  recipients  (N = 136)Control  group  (N = 25) p value Age, years (mean,  SD)58.6 (12.7) 52.7 (11.5) .028 Sex, female (%) 25 (18.3) 17 (68) <.001 Days after first  vaccine dose  (median, IQR)36.5 (8.3) 37.8 (4.6) .29 Days after second  vaccine dose,  (median, IQR)16.5 (6.2) 16.8 (2.9) .43 Abbreviations: IQR, interquartile range; SD, standard deviation.  16006143, 2021, 8, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajt.16615 by Cochrane Germany, Wiley Online Library on [07/12/2023].

GRUPPER Et al.2722  |   AJT 3.2  |  Humoral response of kidney transplant  recipients compared to controls All participants in the control group had a positive antibody response  to spike protein, while only 51 of 136 transplant recipients (37.5%)  had positive serology ( p < .001). The mean IgG anti-  spike level in the kidney transplant group (me - dian = 5.9 (IQR 3.8–  42.0 AU/mL) was lower than in the control group  (median = 189.0 [IQR 141.10–  248] AU/mL). A Mann–  Whitney test  indicated that this difference was statistically significant (u = 69.5,  p < .001) (Figure  1). In addition, even in seropositive recipients, mean  antibody levels were significantly lower compared to controls (me - dian = 71.8 [IQR 37.6–  111.7] vs. 189.0 [IQR 141.10–  248] AU/mL),  study and control groups, respectively; p < .001). 3.3  |  Risk factors for negative serology Table 2 shows clinical and laboratory data of transplant recipients  with positive and negative antibody response. Participants with  a positive anti-  spike serology were significantly younger, had a  shorter period of time on maintenance dialysis before transplanta - tion, and had a higher prevalence of living donors. The main differ - ence in immunosuppression between the two groups was a lower  rate of treatment with MMF and a lower rate of triple maintenance  immunosuppression in seropositive patients. Patients with a posi - tive postvaccination antibody levels had a significantly higher eGFR  in addition to a higher mean hemoglobin and lymphocyte count.  Longer period of time since transplantation was significantly associ - ated with positive response to the vaccination. When multivariate analysis was performed, variables associated  with negative humoral response were older age (odds ratio 1.66  [95% confidence interval 1.17–  2.69], p = .026), high-  dose cortico - steroids in the last 12 months (1.3 [1.09–  1.86], p = .048], mainte - nance with triple immunosuppressive medications (1.43 [1.06–  2.15],  p = .038], and a regimen that includes MMF (1.47 [1.26–  2.27], p = .049] (Figure 2). A moderate multicollinearity (VIF = 9.3) for MMF  and triple immunosuppression regimen was found. In the control group, we found a trend of inverse correlation be - tween age and antibody levels (correlation coefficient = −0.27, p=  .084); however, it did not reach statistical significance. 4 | DISCUSSION Organ transplant recipients exhibit worse outcome from SARS-  CoV-  2 infection, due to comorbidities and immunosuppression.13,14  Accordingly, an effective and safe vaccination against SARS-  CoV-  2 is  critical in this population. Data regarding the safety of mRNA SARS-   CoV-  2 vaccines in solid organ transplant recipients are scarce since  there were no transplant recipients in the phase 3 trials of Moderna7  or Pfizer.6 In the current study we report, for the first time to best of our  knowledge, the serologic response to full mRNA SARS-  CoV-  2 vac - cine among kidney transplant recipients, who did not have a prior ex - posure to the virus (by including only participants with undetectable  level of IgG against SARS-  CoV-  2 nucleocapsid protein). mRNA SARS-  CoV-  2 vaccines, similar to other common vaccines,  are noted to cause mild to moderate side effects, including local  pain, headaches, and fatigue, in immunocompetent individuals.15 A  recent publication describing 187 transplant recipients who were  vaccinated with Pfizer and Moderna vaccines did not show any un - expected short-  term local and systemic side effects following the  vaccine administration.16 In our cohorts, in accordance with that,  most common side effect was mild local pain, without major adverse  events. We could not find any correlation of the vaccine side effects  or their severity to humoral response, or any difference in the side  effects between controls and kidney transplant recipients. Despite a theoretical concern that vaccination may trigger organ  rejection,17,18 numerous trials of some common vaccines have shown  no casual association between the two.1 9 - 2 3 Our study confirms the  safety of mRNA SARS-  CoV-  2 vaccine (BNT162b2, Pfizer-  BioNTech)  in kidney transplant recipients, as no biopsy-  proven rejection was  documented during the follow-  up period. Our most impressive finding was that only 37.5% of kidney trans - plant recipients mount an appreciable anti-  spike antibody response, in  contrast to healthy controls who had a robust and universal humoral  response, similar to recent studies of immunocompetent individuals.24  This reduced rate of response among transplant recipients to vaccina - tion was described in previous studies exploring other common vac - cines, including pneumococcal vaccination,25,26 hepatitis B virus,5,27  and influenza.28 Recently, Boyarsky et al8 found poor immune response  following a single dose of mRNA SARS CoV-  2 vaccine in solid organ  transplant recipients, with a rate of only 31 out of 219 (14.1%) kidney  recipients had a detectable IgG anti-  spike. The clinical significance of  this finding should be further evaluated. In our 3 months follow-  up,  two patients in seronegative group developed severe COVID-  19 infec - tion, while no infection was documented in seropositive group, but our  follow-  up was not long enough to evaluate clinical outcomes.FIGURE 1 Scatterplot of IgG anti S of both groups.

GRUPPER Et al.   |  2723AJT In addition, we demonstrated a reduced level of antibodies  even in seropositive kidney transplant recipients. The clinical sig - nificance of this finding should be further evaluated. Although  studies in SARS-  CoV-  2- infected individuals demonstrated a correlation between neutralizing antibody level and COVID-  19  severity,29 there is no well-  established protective antibody  threshold. Further studies are needed in order to determine  whether patients with a positive albeit low antibody level possess TABLE 2  Comparison of recipients with negative vs positive serology Variable Negative Positive p value Number 85 51 Agea  60.9 (12.2) 54.55 (12.8) .005 Sex, female (%) 32 (37.6) 17 (33.3) .71 BMI 26.71 (4.2) 27.40 (3.9) .35 Time on dialysis before transplantation, months 28.34 (35.5) 12.47 (19.1) .001 Time post first transplantation, monthsb  56.6 (67.9) 87.7 (95.6) .05 Time post last transplantation, monthsc  49.1 (54.8) 68.9 (69.4) .076 First transplant (%) 76 (89.4) 45 (88.2) 1.0 Etiology for kidney failure Diabetes/nephrosclerosis 37 13 .61 Glomerulonephritis 18 14 Polycystic kidney 14 6 Other 16 18 Donor type, living (%) 47 (55.2) 37 (72.5) .03 SPK, (%) 6 (7.0) 3 (5.8) 1 Hypertension, (%) 70 (82.3) 39 (76) .50 Diabetes mellitus, (%) 39 (45.9) 20 (3.2) .47 High-  dose steroids last 12 months, (%) 25 (29.4) 7 (13.7) .038 Antithymocyte globulin last 12 months, (%) 9 (10.5) 1 (1.9) .08 Rituximab last 12 months 3 (3.5) 1 (1.9) 1.0 Low-  dose prednisone, (%) 79 (92.9) 42 (82.3) .08 CNIs, (%) 77 (90.5) 46 (90.1) 1.0 Mean tacrolimus level, ng/mL 7.3 (2.7) 6.9 (2.1) .41 mTORs, (%) 5 (5.8) 5 (9.8) .50 MMF, % 72 (84.7) 32 (62.7) .006 Median (IQR) dose of mycophenolate sodium, mg/day 360 (360–  720) 360 (360–  720) .15 Triple maintenance immunosuppression, % 73 (85.9) 34 (66.6) .044 Hemoglobin, g/dL 13.41 (1.9) 14.03 (1.5) .07 White blood cell count, 10e3/µL 8.37 (2.6) 8.54 (2.5) .70 Neutrophil count, 10e3/µL 5.53 (2.1) 5.24 (1.6) .46 Lymphocyte count, 10e3/µL 1.83 (0.9) 2.27 (0.8) .013 Serum creatinine, mg/dL 1.42 (0.6) 1.14 (0.32) .002 eGFR, ml/min/m259.4 (21.7) 72.6 (20.5) .001 Serum albumin 39.8 (11.4) 40.1 (13.0) .89 Days after first dose 36.7 (4.6) 36.1 (4.9) .85 Days after second dose 16.8 (5.3) 16.1 (5.9) .91 Abbreviations: BMI, body mass index; CNIs, calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus or cyclosporin); eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate; MMF,  mycophenolate mofetil or mycophenolate sodium; mTORs, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors; SPK, simultaneous pancreas and kidney  transplantation.

GRUPPER Et al.2724  |   AJT a higher risk of SARS-  CoV-  2 infection, as well as the duration of  the response. The most significant predictors of failure to mount a humoral re - sponse in our cohort of kidney transplant recipients were advanced  age, need for high- dose corticosteroids during the last (prevaccina - tion) year, maintenance with three immunosuppressive medications,  and a regimen that includes MMF. Some association between advanced age and positive but lower  antibody response was found in immunocompetent patients after  C O V I D -  1 9 ,30 a s  w e l l  a s  a f t e r  m R N A  S A R S -  C o V -  2  v a c c i n a t i o n .31,32  Our finding indicates that even in immunosuppressed patients age  may be an independent predictor of poor immunological response.  In our control group, there was an inverse trend of age and antibody  level; however, it was not statistically significant. The influence of different immunosuppressive regimens on  vaccination response was explored in previous years. A number of  studies evaluated response rates to influenza and pneumococcal  vaccines in patients receiving glucocorticoids. While immune re- sponse was preserved, although mildly reduced, in most patients on  chronic low dose of glucocorticoids,3 3 - 3 5 th e  r es po n s e  w a s  i n a d e - quate in patients on high dose.36 Our findings in regard to mRNA  SARS CoV-  2 vaccine demonstrate concordant results with signifi - cant reduction of the humoral immune response during the first year  following high-  dose steroids treatment. Similarly, MMF has a well-  known suppressive effect on the im - mune system, including the inhibition of antibody production.37,38  Our finding of a significant decrease in vaccination response in kid - ney recipients on MMF treatment is in line with previous reports,  which demonstrated a dose-  related correlation of MMF with de - creased influenza and cholera vaccine responsiveness in renal trans - plant subjects.28,39-  42 We could not find an independent association between vaccine  humoral immune response and treatment with antithymocyte globulin  during the prevaccination year. Although the small number of partici - pants who received this treatment preclude us from a valid conclusion,  these findings are in agreement with result of influenza vaccination studies, which failed to show a significant relation between induction  immunosuppression and vaccine immunogenicity.43−45 Our study demonstrated that the serological response to vac - cination was related to the net burden of immunosuppression: the  greater the degree of immunosuppression, the less likely the patient  will respond to immunization (OR 1.43 for triple vs double immu - nosuppressive regimens). This finding is not only clinically obvious,  but also supported by previous studies that found an increased risk  to poor seroprotection46 and increased infection rates47 with triple  maintenance immunosuppression regimen. Our main finding of such a low immunization rate after admin - istration of full dose of BNT162b2 SARS-  CoV-  2 vaccine (Pfizer-  BioNTech) in kidney transplant recipients raises an urgent question  regarding possible measures to increase recipient's response to  vaccination. Optimal timing may be important in maximizing the response to  immunization following solid organ transplantation. It is common to  wait at least 3 and often up to 12 months after transplantation be - fore giving vaccines, once maintenance immunosuppression levels  have been attained,48,49 in order to maximize the likelihood of devel - oping a protective immune response. In our study, patients shortly  after transplantation demonstrated reduced immune response  rate, but this correlation was not an independent predictor when  high- dose steroids were included into analysis. This finding empha - sizes the need for an individual approach to transplanted patients’  immunization; while specific timing may vary based on individual  circumstance, we should try to vaccinate when the effect of any im - munosuppressive agents is at its nadir.48,49 Strengths of this study include its novelty. It is the first published  data about full SARS-  CoV-  2 vaccine in kidney transplant recipients.  The exclusion of participants with IgG antibodies to nucleocapsid  protein eliminates the possibility of humoral response to the former  virus exposure and validates our results. Limitations of the study include a relatively small sample size, with  a nonmatched control group. Short follow-  up period and absence of  assessing the cellular immune response preclude us to address full FIGURE 2 Multivariate analysis for the  risk of negative serology (odds ratio) in the  transplant recipients' group.

Further follow-  up for clinical outcomes and further stud - ies including patients with prior SARS-  CoV-  2 infection, assessing the  humoral response in this important setting, are needed. Despite that, our real-  life data of significantly reduced level of  immune response to a full dose of the SARS-  CoV-  2 vaccine in kid - ney transplant recipients warrant prompt consideration and further  studies about possible ways to improve vaccine immunogenicity in  this population. 5 | CONCLUSIONS Our finding of poor humoral response to the BNT162b2 SARS-  CoV-  2 vaccine in transplant recipients suggests that such patients  may remain at high risk for COVID-  19 despite appropriate vaccina - tion. Based on these findings, we strongly suggest that all transplant  recipients should be counseled to continue the practice of protec - tive COVID-  19 measures including wearing masks, hand hygiene,  and social distancing.

Arguments opposing such a policy emphasize justice and respect  for persons, and seek to avoid worsening inequities or medical coercion.

KATES ET Al.2638  |   AJT 1 |  BACKGROUND Ethicists generally frame medical and public health ethical dilemmas  around the principles of beneficence (benefit to the patient and/or the  community), non-maleficence (avoidance of unnecessary harms), justice  (fair and equal treatment), and respect for persons (autonomy and dig- nity).1 Solid organ transplant allocation by the Organ Procurement and  Transplantation Network (OPTN) is informed by utility, or maximizing  benefit for the greatest number of people, and justice, or fair distribu- tion of resources.2 Transplant providers and centers serve as gatekeep- ers to transplant waiting lists. Regarding non-medical candidate criteria,  the OPTN recommends that centers adopt policies that are broad, and  universal, while also being attentive to unique individual circumstances.  Lifestyle choices such as tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drug use are consid- ered relative contraindications to transplantation, with individual cen- ters specifying how these factors must be addressed prior to listing. The  OPTN has recommended that adherence to treatment recommenda- tions may be an appropriate non-medical consideration, specifically in  cases of “serious, consistent, and documented non-compliance.”3 The number of people in the United States who refuse routine  vaccination has increased. Despite Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention (CDC) recommendations for universal influenza vac - cination, influenza vaccine coverage among adults is only 44.8%.  Pneumococcal vaccine coverage among adults with an indication to  be vaccinated is only 23%.4 In 2019, the CDC estimated that, for  kindergarteners, nationwide measles vaccine coverage was 94.7%,  and as low as 87.4% in Colorado. The number of kindergarteners  with a registered exemption from at least one required vaccination  had risen to 2.5% from 2.1% in 2017, and the majority of exemptions  were non-medical, including philosophical objections (2.2% of chil - dren nationwide and up to 7.5% in Oregon).5 Pediatricians report dis - missing children of vaccine-refusing parents from their practices at  an increasing rate, up to 11.7% in 2013, citing lack of trust between  parents and the healthcare team and concern for other patients.6 Vaccine hesitancy has been linked to ideas about bodily autonomy  and parental authority, as well as mistrust of science, medicine, and gov - ernment.7 A vocal anti-vaccination movement promotes these beliefs and  advocates for vaccine refusal. While many patients expressing hesitancy  may be persuaded by counseling and education, some patients persist  in outright refusal. As a consequence of under-vaccination, outbreaks of  vaccine-preventable illnesses are occurring at an increasing rate.5,8 Transplant providers recommend that candidates receive vac - cines on an accelerated timeline.9 Despite this regimen, a 2019 study found that <90% of pediatric liver transplant recipients were up to  date on live vaccinations before their transplant, and only 55% were  up to date on all age-appropriate vaccinations, although reasons for  under-vaccination were not specified.10 In a 2011 survey of pediatric  organ transplant programs, 39% of programs had experienced cases  involving caregiver refusal of vaccination for non-medical reasons  (i.e., philosophical or religious objections or beliefs that vaccines are  unnecessary or unsafe). When presented with a hypothetical sce - nario of a patient whose guardian had refused all vaccinations, 47%  of respondents reported that their program would list the patient  for transplantation, 22% said they would not, and 30% were unsure;  only 4% of pediatric transplant programs reported having a written  policy regarding vaccine refusal.11 Adult transplant practices have  never been studied in the same way. Currently, no national policy  addresses this issue, although guidelines universally recommend  routine vaccination for transplant candidates.9,12 2 | OBJECTIVES The authors are comprised of transplant infectious diseases profes - sionals and bioethicists with experience in transplantation and vac - cination from both adult and pediatric transplant centers throughout  the United States. We collaborated on this manuscript to advocate  for further discussion with a broader group of experts and stake - holders prior to issuing any “consensus” policy. This paper reviews  existing data on the relationship of vaccination and non-vaccination  with transplant outcomes, and presents ethical arguments to the  question: “Is it ethically permissible to institute a policy of deny - ing solid organ transplantation on the basis of refusal of medically  indicated vaccinations?” (Table 1). We also assess these arguments  within the special cases of pediatric transplantation, emergent trans - plantation, and living donation, with the intent of stimulating discus - sion toward a uniform guideline. 3 | ARGUMENTS IN SUPPORT  OF DENYING SOLID ORGAN  TRANSPLANTATION ON THE BASIS OF  VACCINE REFUSAL Proponents argue that denying organ transplantation to patients  who refuse vaccines is justified based on the medical benefits of  vaccination for transplant recipients, stewardship of the scarce resolve this ethical dilemma and establish a consistent, fair, and standard approach to  vaccine refusal in transplantation.

KATES ET Al.   |  2639AJT resource of donated organs, and improvement in the general utility  of transplantation (Table  2). At the individual level, patients who are  under-vaccinated face greater risk of poor outcomes for themselves  and for their grafts.13 For example, while some vaccine-preventable  illnesses are rare, others such as pneumococcal pneumonia and in - fluenza are common and result in significant morbidity and mortality  among solid organ transplant recipients.14 Transplant recipients who  have an impaired immune response from anti-rejection medications  may suffer even more severe presentations of vaccine-preventable  illness, including accelerated progression of human papillomavirus- associated cervical and anal carcinomas.15 Liver transplant candi - dates who are vaccinated against Hepatitis B can be considered for  transplants from hepatitis B core antibody-positive donors, while  candidates who are not vaccinated either cannot be considered or  require posttransplant treatment.16 Diagnosing vaccine-preventable  illness may be more challenging in transplant recipients because of  atypical presentations and the broad differential diagnosis for com - mon symptoms like fever and rash. Complications of vaccine-pre - ventable illnesses may include allograft rejection.17,18 These risks may extend to other recipients and candidates at the  transplant center, patients who are immunosuppressed because of  other medical conditions treated at a large medical center, and to the  general population. Other patients may be put at undue risk regard - less of their own desire to get vaccinated. Documented instances  of measles transmission from unvaccinated infected patients in the  clinic setting have occurred, including to vaccinated patients.19,20 At  the community level, a high proportion of non-medical exemptions  for required vaccines has been associated with heightened risk for  both unvaccinated and vaccinated community members.21 Thus,  from a public health ethics perspective, non-maleficence to the com - munity must also be considered. Difficulty diagnosing vaccine-preventable illnesses in the trans- plant recipient population also poses challenges for infection preven- tion and control. Delayed detection, high viral loads, and prolonged viral shedding in the context of immunosuppression increase the risk  of transmissions from these patients.22 Costs can be considerable  even for one exposure, as crucial prevention strategies like intrave- nous immune globulin are expensive, and in short supply.23 Transplant  programs may face legal or regulatory questions about the level of pro- tection provided to patients who develop vaccine-preventable illness,  or to patients affected by subsequent infections or exposures.24 An  outbreak can shut a transplant center down completely, with adverse  effects for all patients served by that center. Many proponents of vaccination requirements also argue that  patients who refuse vaccination may hesitate when presented with  the more intensive and invasive demands of transplantation includ - ing multi-agent immunosuppression, routine procedural testing (i.e.,  biopsies), dietary restrictions, etc. Although data supporting this  conjecture are sparse, pediatric patients whose guardians refuse  vaccination present less frequently for routine care, as documented  in one study.25 This argument is clearly weighed very highly by trans - plant clinicians; in the aforementioned survey of pediatric transplant  centers, 70% of respondents cited possible non-adherence to post - transplantation care as the leading rationale for considering vaccine  refusal in listing decisions.11 If validated, this concern would align  with recommendations from the OPTN that “serious, consistent, and  documented non-compliance” be considered in listing decisions.3 Arguments in support of denying solid organ transplantation on  the basis of vaccine refusal must also address concerns about fairness  and autonomy. Proponents argue that not listing such patients would  be fair because access to transplantation would be restricted based  on a factor that is within the patient's control. Some patients opposed  to vaccination might object that restricting access to transplantation  represents a violation of autonomy.

KATES ET Al.2640  |   AJT the utility of transplantation. This example is similar to many socially  accepted public health situations in which infringement of personal  autonomy is ethically permissible and legally mandated in order to pro - tect the well-being of the population (i.e., tobacco policy).26 4 | ARGUMENTS IN OPPOSITION  TO DENYING SOLID ORGAN  TRANSPLANTATION ON THE BASIS OF  VACCINE REFUSAL Opponents of denying transplantation to patients who refuse vac - cination may recognize the safety, cost-effectiveness, and indi - vidual and public health benefits of vaccination, but still feel that  denying transplantation on the basis of vaccine refusal crosses a  moral boundary. Their arguments challenge claims that vaccination  substantially increases overall utility and raises concerns about  justice and autonomy. Because vaccine refusal is, so far, uncom - mon, the difference in transplant outcomes between vaccinated  and non-vaccinated recipients would have to be substantial to  justify excluding vaccine-refusing patients on the basis of overall  utility. While case reports describe severe outcomes from vaccine- preventable illness, many presentations, at least in immunocom - petent hosts, are associated with low mortality and manageable morbidity. Some outcomes may be more favorable today than  when vaccine-preventable illnesses were last widespread, owing  to improvements in treatment and supportive care.27 All of these  considerations would attenuate the benefits of mandatory vacci - nation. From the perspective of the individual patient, even under- vaccinated, receiving a transplant clearly remains in that patient's  best interest. When considering the principles of beneficence and  non-maleficence, opponents of vaccination requirements weigh  the immediate, certain, and severe harms of denial of organ trans - plantation much more heavily than the possibility of downstream  complications due to vaccine-preventable illness. Claims about  community risk can also be challenged, particularly outside of  larger community outbreaks or clusters. Studies of community risk  deal with geographic areas where there is extensive, long-term  commingling in schools, workplaces, and public spaces, and are  not representative of healthcare environments. If non-vaccination decreases patient and graft survival (utility),  then patients who are unable to be vaccinated for a medical contra - indication and patients who fail to mount a protective immune re - sponse after vaccination would also need to be considered less than  ideal transplant candidates, but this is not being proposed. The claim  that vaccine-refusing patients will also be non-adherent to other  recommended treatments remains untested.7 W h i l e  O P T N  e t h - ics guidelines advise transplant programs to consider documented TABLE 2 Levels of risk associated with vaccine refusal in solid organ transplantation Individual Community      Recipient • Increased risk of vaccine-preventable illness and sequelae • Delayed diagnosis due to atypical presentations and broad differential • Risk of non-adherence to other therapies and sequelae Other patients • Risk of transmission to solid-organ transplant patients in the clinic or  transplant unit • Risk of transmission events to other vulnerable patients outside of  transplantation Institutional environment • Risk of transmission to hospital staff • High cost and limited availability of post-exposure treatments Transplant center • Risk of legal liability related to individual outcomes, transmissions, or  exposures • Risk of temporary shutdowns related to infectious disease outbreaks Graft • Risk of graft failure or dysfunction from vaccine-preventable illness • Risk of graft failure or dysfunction from non-adherence to other  therapies • Missed opportunity to allocate to another recipient with potentially  better risk profile  16006143, 2021, 8, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajt.16472 by Cochrane Germany, Wiley Online Library on [07/12/2023].

KATES ET Al.   |  2641AJT non-adherence in wait-listing decisions, the OPTN emphasizes that  some pretransplant behaviors like dietary indiscretion or missing  dialysis may not be indicators of posttransplant behaviors, and the  same may be true for vaccine refusal.28 In the absence of evidence  linking vaccine refusal to posttransplant behavior, taking patients  at their word about their beliefs and intentions toward other treat - ments beside vaccination may be more respectful. Injustices resulting from vaccine requirements are nuanced in the  context of existing social structures. Vaccine refusal differs by racial,  ethnic, socioeconomic, or religious groups. A large proportion of vac - cine refusers are white and well educated, a group that is not typically  marginalized or structurally oppressed. However, vaccine hesitancy is  also more common among African Americans than the general pop - ulation, with community members in one study citing past instances  of medical abuse against African Americans as sources of ongoing  fear and mistrust of the medical system.29 Denial of organ transplan - tation to patients who have refused vaccination because of mistrust  earned from historic mistreatment of marginalized communities may  increase inequities in transplantation and exacerbate transgenerational  traumas. Clusters of vaccine-preventable illness related to societal or  religious vaccine refusals have also occurred among Orthodox Jewish  communities in New York, Somali-Americans in Minnesota, and on the  United States-affiliated island of Samoa.30 Opponents of mandatory  vaccination emphasize the risk of magnifying existing disparities in  transplantation by disproportionately affecting people of color, immi - grants, non-English language speakers, or minority religious groups.31 Finally, opponents of vaccination requirements argue that such  policies may be coercive, by tying access to a life-saving medical  intervention to preventive care that the patient has historically re - fused. Medical coercion occurs when a patient is compelled to ac - cept a proposal (such as vaccination) that they otherwise may reject  because of an imposed threat of an unacceptably worse outcome.32  Importantly, based on this definition of coercion, such an outcome  (not receiving an organ transplant) must be below a standard that  patient is normally entitled to.33 When coercion occurs, it is a seri - ous violation of respect for persons and may damage the provider– patient relationship.34 Even if we conclude that the patient is not  normally entitled to receiving an organ transplant, the perception  of coercion alone may be damaging.35 Vaccine requirements shift  clinical practice away from education and shared decision-making.  Rather than promoting vaccine acceptance, these policies may val - idate accusations of single-mindedness and lack of respect, further  alienating those expressing vaccine hesitancy and further damaging,  rather than improving, population health (beneficence, utility). 5 | SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 5.1  |  Which vaccines should be required? All recommended vaccines have substantial individual and public  health importance and a proven safety record, and vaccination is  prioritized prior to transplantation to maximize safety and efficacy. Any proposed vaccine requirements should be consistent across in - stitutions and rooted in established evidence. This could be achieved  by basing requirements on existing guidelines from national organi - zations such as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices  (ACIP).36 Most insurance plans and many state-sponsored programs  cover ACIP-recommended vaccinations or provide them for free,  and the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program offers a  mechanism for redress of vaccine injury petitions related to cov - ered vaccines.37 S o m e  t r a n s p l a n t  p r o g r a m s  m a y  e n c o u r a g e  a d d i - tional off-schedule vaccination or vaccines not yet approved for this  population, but individualized recommendations above and beyond  a standard group of vaccines should not be included in a policy of  vaccine requirements. For new vaccines, such as those currently  in development for SARS-CoV-2, a demonstrated track record of  safety and efficacy must be established before these vaccines will  be included in ACIP recommendations. In addition, as with other  new agents, safety and efficacy should be demonstrated for pa - tients with end-stage organ dysfunction or organ transplants, and  any theoretical risk for immunostimulation must be considered prior  to updating vaccine requirements specific to transplant candidates. 5.2  |  Children of vaccine-refusing guardians Requiring vaccination prior to transplantation may result in some  children being vaccinated, but may also lead to rare scenarios where  a child faces the loss of a life-saving opportunity because of their  guardians’ unwavering convictions. Some state courts have estab - lished a legal precedent that parental vaccine refusal may be viewed  as medical neglect, but generally focus on engaging parents over  time rather than more intrusive measures.38 While education should  be emphasized, the accelerated vaccination timeline prior to trans - plantation or some cases of persistent vaccine refusal may lead to  situations where agreement cannot be reached. In these situations,  transplant programs would need to carefully consider whether to  involve state actors (child protection agencies, courts) to accomplish  vaccination of children over parental objection prior to transplanta - tion. There is precedent for treatment over parental objection when  children face serious, immediate harm from parental decisions, as  with blood transfusion for children of Jehovah's witnesses.39 While  there is no comparable precedent for state agencies or courts to re - quire routine vaccination of children over parental objection, it could  be argued that if transplantation is essential to the welfare of the  child and it cannot be performed unless the child is vaccinated, the  threshold for state intervention has been met. 5.3  |  Emergent transplantation Fulminant organ failure requiring emergent transplantation may not  afford an opportunity for in-depth counseling about vaccines, and  even when counseling can occur, these patients are vulnerable by  virtue of the lack of time to consider their options. Even if a patient   16006143, 2021, 8, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajt.16472 by Cochrane Germany, Wiley Online Library on [07/12/2023].

However, transplant centers have  an obligation to proceed with living donation only when there is a good  chance of safety and benefit for both the donor and recipient, and the  importance of vaccination for recipients remains a reasonable consid - eration.41 Whether or not a policy requiring vaccination for deceased  donor transplantation is enacted, potential living donors should be in - formed that recipients who refuse vaccination may be at increased risk  for adverse outcomes, consistent with OPTN policy regarding informed  consent for living donation.42 Recipients who refuse vaccination despite  education and counseling should be instructed to take every possible  action to protect themselves from infection, and transplant centers  should also take actions to protect other patients, for example, by re - quiring that unvaccinated patients wear a mask in the waiting room. 6 | CONCLUSION Vaccine refusal has contributed to the increasing incidence of  vaccine-preventable illnesses. Patients pursuing solid organ transplantation may be among those who are unvaccinated or  under-vaccinated due to vaccine refusal or hesitancy. Transplant  centers screening patients for their appropriateness for listing  may desire to include vaccination status as a part of this evalu - ation. The ethical frameworks of beneficence and utility provide  the justification for denying solid organ transplantation on the  basis of vaccine refusal. Risks to the graft, the patient, other pa - tients in the clinical environment, the transplant program, and so - ciety should all be considered. Opponents of such policies voice  concerns with regard to justice, autonomy, and medical coercion.  These issues require special consideration in situations of pediatric  transplantation, emergent transplantation, and living donation. A  uniform national policy developed with input from a diverse group  of stakeholders is urgently needed to standardize the approach to  this challenge. We have proposed a policy development process  beginning with baseline needs assessment and coalition building,  followed by detailed review, and ratification by national trans - plant organizations (Figure 1). Bringing together a diverse group  of experts to address key parallel considerations such as vaccine  access, cost, education for candidates, families, and clinicians,  and contingency planning for adverse events will establish a safe,  equitable, and trustworthy context for deploying any new policy.  Finally, we propose ongoing assessment of vaccination practices,  outcomes after transplantation, impact on equity in transplanta - tion, and public opinion after implementation. Ultimately, a clearly articulated policy could reinforce the im - portance of vaccination prior to transplantation, guide discussions  between transplant teams and candidates, and lead to consistent  treatment of all candidates nationally. Given rising rates of vaccine  hesitancy and refusal, increasing outbreaks of vaccine-preventable  illness, and the recent emergence of a novel infectious threat with TABLE 3 Preliminary best practices for transplantation when working with non-vaccinated patients Before Transplant • Candidates should be evaluated by an infectious diseases physician prior to transplant44 • Clinicians should obtain a detailed immunization history and serologic evaluation9 • The transplant team should counsel candidates about the importance of vaccination and the added benefits of  completing vaccination before transplant • Educational materials should be developed in partnership with community representatives, with a focus on cultural  competency.

These practices do not replace specific recommendations from public health organizations which may include  universal masking, physical distancing, or stay at home orders.   16006143, 2021, 8, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajt.16472 by Cochrane Germany, Wiley Online Library on [07/12/2023].

Email: kauld@umich.eduAbstract We describe a case of proven transmission of SARS-  CoV-  2 from lung donor to re - cipient. The donor had no clinical history or findings suggestive of infection with  SARS-  CoV-  2 and tested negative by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reac - tion (RT-  PCR) on a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab obtained within 48 h of procurement.  Lower respiratory tract testing was not performed. The recipient developed fever,  hypotension, and pulmonary infiltrates on posttransplant day (PTD) 3, and RT-  PCR  testing for SARS-  CoV-  2 on an NP swab specimen was non- reactive, but positive on  bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. One thoracic surgeon present during the trans - plantation procedure developed COVID-  19. Sequence analysis of isolates from donor  BAL fluid (obtained at procurement), the recipient, and the infected thoracic surgeon  proved donor origin of recipient and health-  care worker (HCW) infection. No other  organs were procured from this donor. Transplant centers and organ procurement or - ganizations should perform SARS-  CoV-  2 testing of lower respiratory tract specimens  from potential lung donors, and consider enhanced personal protective equipment for  HCWs involved in lung procurement and transplantation. KEYWORDS clinical research/practice, donors and donation: donor-  derived infections, infection and  infectious agents –  viral, infectious disease 1 | INTRODUCTION Unexpected transmission of infection from donor to recipient is  uncommon, occurring in fewer than 1% of transplant recipients.1 Nonetheless, donor-  derived disease (DDD) is associated with poor  outcomes including graft loss or death noted in about one-  third of af - fected recipients.1 Emerging pathogens create particular challenges  in assessment of disease transmission risk, and recent infectious  
KAUL et AL.2886  |   AJT agents of concern have included H1N1 pandemic influenza (2009),  West Nile virus, Ebola virus, and Zika virus.2 - 4 The disruption in solid organ transplantation (SOT) resulting  from the COVID-  19 epidemic has, however, been unprecedented.  Particularly in hard-  hit areas early in the pandemic, resource limita - tions led to a drastic decline in SOTs.5 Transplant centers and organ  procurement organizations (OPOs) have been forced to grapple with  many unknowns regarding the most effective donor clinical assess - ment and testing processes to reduce the risk of donor to recipient  disease transmission. Further, OPOs and transplant centers have to  consider how to protect their staff from exposure to potential do - nors infected with SARS-  CoV-  2. To our knowledge, in the United States, no proven case of donor  to recipient transmission of SARS-  CoV-  2 has been reported. We  report a case of proven donor to recipient transmission of SARS-  CoV-  2 despite negative pre-  procurement donor nasopharyngeal  (NP) SARS-  CoV-  2 testing. Lower respiratory tract testing was not  performed. In addition, we describe transmission to a health-  care  worker (HCW) associated with the transplant procedure. 2 | CASE REPORT AND EPIDEMIOLOGIC  INVESTIGATION 2.1  |  Epidemiologic review Laboratory studies and recipient medical records were reviewed.  Donor medical records from DonorNet were also reviewed. At the  transplant center (and for transplant center employees participating  in procurement), per institutional policy, HCWs were considered to  have a high-  risk exposure if prolonged contact occurred while not  wearing appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) (mask and  eyewear protection for routine exposures, and N95/PAPR for aero - sol generating procedures). Exposed employees were notified and  those with high-  risk exposures were instructed to undergo SARS-  CoV-  2 testing 5 days from the last exposure. All employees with low  risk exposures were provided with a list of symptoms consistent  with COVID-  19 and instructed to contact occupational health for  testing should symptoms develop. 2.2  |  Organ donor The organ donor was a woman from the upper Midwest who suf - fered severe brain injury in an automobile accident and quickly pro- gressed to brain death during a 2-  day hospital admission. Computed  tomography (CT) of the chest performed on the day of admission  showed areas of consolidation within the posterior right lower lobe.  The radiologist interpretation was that these areas represented at - electasis and pulmonary contusion. The left lung was clear aside  from mild atelectasis at the base. A bronchoscopy performed 1  day  after admission showed inflammation in the trachea and minimal  thick white secretions, which were not persistent, and submucosal erythema and punctate hemorrhage in the distal trachea and  mainstem bronchi felt to be secondary to contusion. SARS-  CoV-  2  RT- PCR testing was performed within 48 h of procurement on a  nasopharyngeal swab and was resulted as not detected (Roche  Cobas SARS-  CoV-  2, Roche Molecular Systems). History obtained  from family revealed no history of travel or any recent fever, cough,  headache, or diarrhea. It is unknown if the donor had any recent  exposures to persons known or suspected to be infected with  S A R S -  C o V -  2 . 2.3  |  Lung recipient The bilateral lung recipient had chronic obstructive lung disease.  A rapid SARS-  CoV-  2 RT-  PCR performed on an NP swab (DiaSorin  Molecular) was negative 12 h before transplant. The transplant pro - cedure was uncomplicated, and the patient arrived in the intensive  care unit (ICU) mechanically ventilated with low oxygen require- ments and minimal vasoactive support. Her initial immunosuppres - sion included methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg every 12 h for six doses  followed by a taper, tacrolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil without  any induction immunosuppression. A persistently low cardiac index was noted on posttransplant day  (PTD) 2, and a transthoracic echocardiogram revealed acute right  ventricular dysfunction. On PTD 3, the patient developed wors - ening fever, hypotension, and ventilator requirements. CT imaging  of the chest showed multifocal consolidations. Due to the sudden  worsening in respiratory status and evolving lung infiltrates, a bron - choscopy was performed and BAL samples were collected from both  lungs. HCWs present during the bronchoscopy all wore full PPE.  Quantitative culture and Gram stain of the BAL fluid revealed a few  polymorphonuclear leukocytes and no significant bacterial growth.  Due to the atypical presentation of septic shock with cardiomyopa - thy, the BAL fluid was sent for SARS-  CoV-  2 PCR testing along with a  second NP swab. The NP swab was not detected but the BAL sample  was positive for SARS-  CoV-  2 with a low cycle threshold (Ct) value.  Repeat testing the following day revealed positive testing of both  tracheal aspirate and NP swab. Due to concern for donor origin of  the SARS-  CoV-  2, BAL fluid obtained from the donor at the time of  procurement was tested at the transplant center and was positive  with a low Ct value (Table 1). The patient's ongoing posttransplant  course in the ICU was complicated by multisystem organ failure re - quiring prolonged mechanical ventilation and circulatory support.  Specific treatment for COVID-  19 has included remdesivir (two 5-  day  courses) and convalescent plasma on two occasions. Tacrolimus was  continued and mycophenolate mofetil was held; her corticosteroid  dosing was maintained at methylprednisolone 30  mg daily then ta - pered. She developed worsening respiratory distress and required  veno-  venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Her overall  clinical status continued to decline and she was not considered a  candidate for re-  transplantation. Support was withdrawn and she  died on PTD 61. Her SARS-  CoV-  2 PCR remained positive on PTD 60  with a Ct value of 29.3.  16006143, 2021, 8, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajt.16532 by Cochrane Germany, Wiley Online Library on [07/12/2023].

KAUL et AL.   |  2887AJT 2.3.1  |  Epidemiologic investigation Testing for SARS-  CoV-  2 was performed 5 or more days postex - posure for high-  risk exposed HCWs. In addition, some HCW with  low-  risk exposures chose to be tested. While one thoracic surgeon  tested positive for SARS-  CoV-  2 on PTD 4 (Table 1), a surgical trainee,  two anesthesia faculty, two anesthesia and one surgery critical care  trainee, two nurses, the procuring surgeon, and one perfusionist  tested negative. No member of the procurement team was infected.  The surgeon was not present at the time of procurement, but did  prepare the lungs for implantation and performed the transplant  procedure. He did describe potential exposure to mucous and spu - tum when cutting off the bronchial staple line resulting in deflation.  No other exposed HCW was diagnosed with SARS-  CoV-  2 linked to  this event. 2.3.2  |  Laboratory methods All experiments using SARS-  CoV-  2 were performed at the University  of Michigan in compliance with containment procedures in labora - tories approved for use by the University of Michigan Institutional  Biosafety Committee and Environment, Health & Safety. The use of  residual specimens from hospitalized patients with COVID-  19 has  been approved by the University of Michigan Institutional Review  Board. All RT-  PCR testing and associated cycle threshold values were  based on assays performed in the Michigan Medicine Clinical  Microbiology Laboratory including the Simplexa™ COVID-  19 Direct  (DiaSorin) and Alinity m SARS-  CoV-  2 assay (Abbott Molecular) with  limits of detection of 500 and 100 SARS-  CoV-  2 genomic RNA cop - ies/ml, respectively. Viral genomic RNA was extracted from the original specimens  using PureLink Viral RNA Kits (Invitrogen). Complementary DNA cor - responding to the genome was amplified by RT-  PCR in two multiplex  reactions using the ARTIC network V3 primer set. Sequencing librar - ies were prepared using the NEBNext Ultra II kit and sequenced on an  Illumina MiSeq with 2  × 250 bp reads, V2 chemistry. Reads were aligned  to the Wuhan-  1 reference (GenBank: MN908947.3) with BWA-  MEM  version 0.7.15. Sequencing adaptors were removed and the ARTIC primer was trimmed with iVar version 1.2.1. Consensus sequences were  determined with samtools (version 1.5) mpileup and iVar version 1.2.1,  placing an N at reference positions with fewer than 10 reads. Whole genome consensus sequences were aligned to the Wuhan-  Hu- 1 reference with MAFFT (version 7.467)6 as implemented in the  augur pipeline.7 We constructed the phylogenetic tree with IQ-  TREE  using a GTR model and 1000 ultrafast bootstrap replicates and per - formed ancestral reconstruction for node sequences with TreeTime  (version 0.7.6).8 All analysis code, patient sequences, and metadata are avail - able https://github.com/lauri  nglab/  Donor  Deriv  edInf  ection. Original  sequence reads are available at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra under  BioProject. 2.3.3  |  Laboratory results Five of the six sequences were identical at the consensus level:  donor right BAL (PTD 0), recipient left BAL (PTD 3), recipient right  BAL (PTD 3), recipient tracheal aspirate (PTD 4), and recipient na - sopharyngeal swab (PTD 4). The virus from the surgeon differed  at just one position relative to the other samples (Figure 1). We  performed a whole genome phylogenetic analysis with these se - quences—  126 SARS-  CoV-  2 sequences from the same hospital, and  an additional 59 sequences from across the state of Michigan. The  six sequences associated with this case formed a cluster within  clade 20A, which was distinct from other lineages and circulat - ing in Michigan (Figure 1). These data demonstrate that both the  transplant recipient and the surgeon acquired SARS-  CoV-  2 from  the donor lungs. 3 | DISCUSSION We describe a case of donor-  derived infection with SARS-  CoV-  2  with secondary transmission to a HCW. Sequencing proved donor  origin of the infection. Transmission occurred despite RT-  PCR test - ing on a donor NP sample obtained within 48 h of procurement  and no clinical or radiological evidence suggestive of donor infec - tion with SARS-  CoV-  2; lower respiratory tract testing was not TABLE 1  SARS-  CoV-  2 test results Day −2 Day 0 Day +3 Day +4 Day +27 Day +60 Source Donor Donor Recipient Recipient Surgeon Recipient Recipient Recipient Specimen NP swab BALa  NP swab BAL NP swab NP swab NP swab Tracheal  aspirateNP swab NP swab Result Not  detectedPositive  Ct =   8.5/9.5Not  detectedPositive Ct =   8.1/9.2Not  detectedPositive  Ct =   23.6Positive  Ct =   35.7Positive Ct =   9.8/10.4Positive Ct =   13.6/13.9Positive   Ct =   29.3 Abbreviations: BAL, bronchoalveolar lavage; Ct, cycle threshold; NP, nasopharyngeal. aBAL obtained by procurement team and tested at transplant center after recipient tested positive.  bSingle Ct values are representative of SARS-  CoV-  2 RdRp and N genes, shared fluorophore one target (Alinity System); two Ct values are  representative of SARS-  CoV-  2 two targets and ORF1ab genes, separate fluorophores (DiaSorin).   16006143, 2021, 8, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajt.16532 by Cochrane Germany, Wiley Online Library on [07/12/2023].

KAUL et AL.2888  |   AJT performed. Donor-  derived infection with SARS-  CoV-  2 has signifi - cant implications for the health of the recipient, but also for HCWs  who may be exposed prior to recipient diagnosis. Donor-  derived infection with SARS-  CoV-  2 in a lung recipient is  not surprising as donor-  derived infection with viruses that infect the  respiratory tract has been well described.1 While SARS-  CoV-  2 infec - tion has been detected in kidneys, liver, heart, and blood,9,10 no other  organs were donated in this case and thus this report provides no in - formation on the risk of transmission to non-  lung recipients. Of note,  transmission of respiratory viruses (including H1N1 2009 pandemic  influenza) has been almost exclusively detected in lung recipients.1  A recent case series of suspected transmissions based on early post - transplant diagnosis of COVID-  19 revealed no proven donor origin  of infection, but high mortality for early posttransplant COVID-  19.11 While one base pair difference was noted in the transplant sur - geon, an alternative source of infection is highly unlikely, given that  the lineage associated with the donor, recipient, and surgeon se - quences is quite distinct from other viral sequences circulating in  our community at that time. While it is impossible to completely rule  out alternate infection sources based on genome sequencing, trans - mission can lead to fixation of new viral mutations, consistent with  the additional polymorphism in the surgeon. This report does raise questions regarding the appropri - ate SARS-  CoV-  2 screening for potential donors. While Organ  Procurement and Transplantation Network policies do not re - quire SARS-  CoV-  2 donor testing, optional fields were added to  DonorNet to indicate test results.12 T h e  A m e r i c a n  S o c i e t y  o f   Transplantation recommends a combination of clinical and labo - ratory donor screening. Laboratory testing for non-  lung donors  should include at least one sample from the respiratory tract,  and consideration for a second sample obtained within 24– 48 h of procurement. For thoracic organ donors, SARS-  CoV-  2 test - ing of the lower respiratory tract is recommended by both AST  and the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation  (ISHLT), if safe and feasible.13,14 In the reported case, clinical and  laboratory screening was not suggestive of infection with SARS-   CoV-  2, as family reported no suggestive symptoms and pulmonary  imaging showed non-  specific findings consistent with atelectasis  combined with pulmonary contusion (consistent with her motor  vehicle accident), and laboratory screening with RT- PCR per - formed on an NP swab within 48 h of procurement was negative. While testing of BAL fluid for SARS-  CoV-  2 would have diag - nosed donor infection in this case, very limited data exist on the in - cremental sensitivity obtained by SARS-  CoV-  2 testing on BAL fluid  or other lower respiratory tract (LRT) specimens as compared to NP  swabs. Case reports do, however, describe patients with negative  SARS-  CoV-  2 testing in NP swabs but positive tests on BAL spec - imens and testing on BAL fluid may remain positive after testing  on upper respiratory specimens becomes negative.1 5 - 1 7 Barriers to  testing BAL specimens on potential lung donors include lack of val - idation of testing of LRT specimens—  although some assays do have  FDA emergency use authorization on BAL specimens18— as well as  possible difficulty obtaining the LRT specimens in a timely fashion  resulting in delays in procurement. Since both the donor and recipient had negative SARS-  CoV-  2  pre-  procedure testing, by institutional protocol, HCWs were  not required to wear N95 masks and eye protection. During the  double lung transplant procedure, HCWs are exposed to mate - rial expelled from the donor lung and one HCW was proven to  be infected, likely during the transplant. Thus, transplant centers  should consider the possible benefit of N95 masks and eye wear  protection during lung transplantation even with negative donor FIGURE 1 Phylogenetic analysis of the six sequences associated with this case [Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]20C20B 19ACase Samples20A U24076 CC20759 U U29302 C C10741 U C12763 U C23604 A U29710 Cdonor (R) BAL recipient (R) BAL recipient (L) BAL recipient trach aspirate recipient NP  swabthoracic surgeon NP  swab  16006143, 2021, 8, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajt.16532 by Cochrane Germany, Wiley Online Library on [07/12/2023].

While barriers to implementation do  exist, OPOs and transplant centers— particularly in areas of high  SARS-  CoV-  2 transmission in the community—  should perform  SARS-  CoV-  2 testing of LRT specimens on potential lung transplant  donors.

Nguyen Email: uxp1@cdc.gov As of February 8, 2021, 59.3 million doses of vaccines to pre - vent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-  19) had been distributed in  the United States, and 31.6 million persons had received at least  one dose of the COVID-  19 vaccine.1 However, national polls con - ducted before vaccine distribution began suggested that many per - sons were hesitant to receive COVID-  19 vaccination.2 To examine  perceptions toward COVID-  19 vaccine and intentions to be vacci - nated, in September and December 2020, CDC conducted house - hold panel surveys among a representative sample of U.S. adults.  From September to December, vaccination intent (defined as being absolutely certain or very likely to be vaccinated) increased overall (from 39.4% to 49.1%); the largest increase occurred among adults aged ≥65 years. If defined as being absolutely certain, very likely,  or somewhat likely to be vaccinated, vaccination intent increased overall from September (61.9%) to December (68.0%). Vaccination nonintent (defined as not intending to receive a COVID-  19 vacci - nation) decreased among all adults (from 38.1% to 32.1%) and  among most sociodemographic groups. Younger adults, women, non- Hispanic Black (Black) persons, adults living in nonmetropolitan  areas, and adults with lower educational attainment, with lower in - come, and without health insurance were most likely to report lack of intent to receive COVID-  19 vaccine. Intent to receive COVID-  19  vaccine increased among adults aged ≥65 years by 17.1 percent - age points (from 49.1% to 66.2%), among essential workers by 8.8  points (from 37.1% to 45.9%), and among adults aged 18–  64 years  with underlying medical conditions by 5.3 points (from 36.5% to  41.8%). Although confidence in COVID-  19 vaccines increased during  September–  December 2020 in the United States, additional efforts  to tailor messages and implement strategies to further increase the public's confidence, overall and within specific subpopulations, are  needed. Ensuring high and equitable vaccination coverage across all populations is important to prevent the spread of COVID-  19 and  mitigate the impact of the pandemic. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has  issued interim recommendations for COVID-  19 vaccine allocation,  with initial limited supplies of vaccines recommended for healthcare  personnel and residents of long-  term care facilities (phase 1a); front - line essential workers and persons aged ≥75 years (phase 1b); and  persons aged 65–  74 years, persons aged 16–  64 years at high risk for  severe COVID-  19 illness because of underlying medical conditions, *  and other workers in essential and critical infrastructure sectors† not  included in phases 1a and 1b (phase 1c).3,4 Vaccinating a large pro - portion of persons in the United States against COVID-  19 is critical  for preventing SARS-  CoV-  2– associated morbidity and mortality and  helping bring an end to the global pandemic. During September 3–  October 1, CDC conducted a probability-  based Internet panel survey (IPSOS KnowledgePanel)§ of a nationally  representative sample of 3541 U.S. adult panelists aged ≥18 years to  assess intent to receive a COVID-  19 vaccine and perceptions about  the vaccine.5 During December 18–  20, CDC sponsored questions  on two probability-  based household panel omnibus surveys (IPSOS  KnowledgePanel¶ and NORC Amerispeak**) administered to 2033  panelists (approximately 1000 panelists each) to reassess COVID-  19  vaccination intent and related perceptions.†† This activity was re - viewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable fed - eral law and CDC policy.§§ The same questions about COVID-  19  vaccine intentions, perceptions, and reasons for not receiving a  COVID-  19 vaccine were asked in the September and December  © 2021 The American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons 
   |  1651 NGUYEN Et al. surveys. However, most respondents were different for each sur - vey; only 123 panelists (3.5%) completed both the September and  December IPSOS survey. Intent was assessed by response to the fol - lowing question: “If a vaccine against COVID-  19 were available today  at no cost, how likely would you be to get it?” Response options were  “absolutely certain,” “very likely,” “somewhat likely,” and “not likely.” Respondents who answered “absolutely certain” or “very likely” to receive a COVID-  19 vaccination were defined as intending to be vac - cinated, and respondents who answered “not likely” were defined as  not intending to be vaccinated. Vaccination intentions and related perceptions were stratified by the following three mutually exclusive groups representing the ACIP priorities for initial doses of COVID-  19  vaccine after healthcare providers and long-  term care residents: (1)  essential workers, ¶¶ (2) adults aged 18–  64 years with underlying  medical conditions, and (3) adults aged ≥65 years.*** Sample size for  the December surveys was not large enough to stratify the anal - ysis by age group (65–  74 years vs. ≥75 years) or essential worker  subgroups (healthcare personnel, other frontline essential work - ers, and other non-  frontline essential workers). Analyses were also  conducted to provide estimates among all adults and among adults  not included in the initial ACIP priority groups (aged 18–  64 years  with no underlying medical conditions and who were not essential  workers). Responses to questions on intent, perceptions, and rea - sons for not getting vaccinated were examined by sociodemographic characteristics and priority groups for the September and December surveys. Because of similar sampling methods and characteristics of respondents, the averages of the estimates from the two December surveys were calculated, and the difference between the September survey and the average of the December surveys was determined using t-  tests. All surveys were weighted to ensure representative - ness of the U.S. population, and all analyses were conducted using  SAS-  callable SUDAAN (version 11.0; RTI International). From September to December, the proportion of adults report - ing intent to receive COVID-  19 vaccine as absolutely certain or very  likely increased significantly by 9.7% points (from 39.4% to 49.1%),  and the proportion reporting nonintent decreased by 6.0% points (from 38.1% to 32.1%) (Table 1). Among priority groups, intent in - creased by 17.1 percentage points among adults aged ≥65 years  (from 49.1% to 66.2%), by 8.8% points among essential workers (from 37.1% to 45.9%), and by 5.3% points among adults aged 18– 64 years with underlying medical conditions (from 36.5% to 41.8%) (Supplementary Figure, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/101583). Vaccination nonintent differed by sociodemographic charac - teristics and decreased across most socioeconomic groups from September to December (Table 2). For example, nonintent decreased by 10.3 percentage points among adults aged 50–  64 years and by  11.1 percentage points among adults aged ≥65 years. Although  nonintent was higher among women, nonintent among both women  and men decreased by 6.0 percentage points between September and December. Nonintent was highest among Black persons in September (56.1%) and December (46.5%) compared with other ra - cial/ethnic groups, with the difference between months (−9.6) not statistically significant. Nonintent was higher among adults with lower educational attainment and lower income but decreased across most education and income categories: among adults with a high school diploma or less, nonintent decreased 7.9% points, and in households with annual incomes of $35 000–  $49 999, nonintent  decreased by 10.8% points. Vaccination nonintent also decreased in  metropolitan statistical areas ††† by 6.7% points and among adults  in all regions of the United States, except the Northeast, including decreases of 8.3% points in the South, 6.8 in the Midwest, and 6.8 in the West. In December, nonintent was highest among persons with - out health insurance (44.5%), compared with those who had private health insurance (30.7%) and public health insurance (29.6%), and was similar in September and December. Among adults in the December surveys who did not intend to get  vaccinated, the main reasons most frequently cited were concerns about side effects and safety of the COVID-  19 vaccine (29.8%),  planning to wait to see if the vaccine is safe and consider receiving  it later (14.5%), lack of trust in the government (12.5%), and con - cern that COVID-  19 vaccines were developed too quickly (10.4%)  (Table 3). A larger percentage of the December survey participants  than September participants reported safety concerns as a main rea - son (29.8% vs. 23.4%), and a smaller percentage reported concern that vaccines were developed too quickly (10.4% vs. 21.6%). 1 | DISCUSSION From September to December 2020, vaccination intent increased among all adults by approximately 10 percentage points and across Summary What is already known about this topic?National polls conducted before vaccine distribution began suggested that many persons were hesitant to re - ceive COVID-  19 vaccination. What is added by this report? From September to December 2020, intent to receive COVID-  19 vaccination increased from 39.4% to 49.1%  among adults and across all priority groups, and nonin - tent decreased from 38.1% to 32.1%. Despite decreases in  nonintent from September to December, younger adults, women, non- Hispanic Black adults, adults living in nonmet - ropolitan areas, and adults with less education and income, and without health insurance continue to have the highest estimates of nonintent to receive COVID-  19 vaccination. What are the implications for public health practice? Ensuring high and equitable vaccination coverage among all populations, including by addressing reasons for not intending to receive vaccination, is critical to prevent the spread of COVID-  19 and bring an end to the pandemic.  16006143, 2021, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajt.16560 by Cochrane Germany, Wiley Online Library on [07/12/2023].

However, despite increases in vaccination intent since September, 5 only about half of persons aged 18–  64 years sur - veyed in December reported being very likely to receive COVID-  19  vaccination, even among those who were essential workers and per - sons aged 18–  64 years with underlying medical conditions. Younger adults, women, Black persons, adults living in nonmetropolitan  areas, and adults with lower educational attainment, with lower in - come, and without insurance were most likely to report that they did not intend to receive COVID-  19 vaccination. Several studies found  similar percentages and trends in vaccination intent and low likeli - hood of receiving a COVID-  19 vaccine among groups disproportion - ately affected by COVID-  19, including Black persons and those with  lower educational attainment. 6,7 Because many of these groups are TABLE 1  COVID-  19 vaccination intent among surveyed adults, by vaccination priority group —  United States, September and December  2020 CharacteristicWeighted % (95% CI) IPSOS, Sep 2020*  (n = 3541)IPSOS, Dec 2020†   (n = 1005)NORC, Dec 2020§   (n = 1028)Average of Dec  IPSOS†  and NORC§   estimates (n = 2,033)Difference between Dec and Sep estimates ¶  All adults Intent to get COVID-  19 vaccine Absolutely certain/ very likely**39.4 (37.7–  41.2) 50.3 (46.9–  53.6) 47.8 (42.7–  52.8) 49.1 (46.0–  52.1) 9.7 (6.2–  13.2) Somewhat likely 22.5 (21.0–  24.0) 16.8 (14.2– 19.4) 21.0 (17.4–  24.8) 18.9 (16.4–  21.4) −3.6 (−6.5 to −0.7) Not likely 38.1 (36.4–  39.8) 33.0 (29.7–  36.2) 31.2 (26.5–  35.8) 32.1 (29.6–  34.6) −6.0 (−9.0 to −3.0) Essential workers Intent to get COVID−19 vaccine Absolutely certain/ Very likely**37.1 (34.2–  40.0) 49.0 (42.9–  55.1) 42.8 (34.9–  50.6) 45.9 (40.9–  50.9) 8.8 (3.0–  14.6) Somewhat likely 22.8 (20.2–  25.3) 14.4 (9.9–  19.1) 23.0 (16.6– 29.6) 18.7 (14.0–  23.4) −4.1 (−9.4 to 1.2) Not likely 40.2 (37.3–  43.2) 36.6 (30.7–  42.3) 34.2 (25.8–  42.6) 35.4 (30.8–  40.0) −4.8 (−10.3 to 0.7) Adults aged ≥65 years Intent to get COVID-  19 vaccine Absolutely certain/ very likely**49.1 (45.6–  52.6) 66.5 (60.0–  73.0) 65.8 (59.0–  72.6) 66.2 (61.5–  70.8) 17.1 (11.3–  22.9) Somewhat likely 21.1 (18.3– 23.9) 12.8 (8.4–  17.2) 17.4 (12.0–  22.9) 15.1 (11.6–  18.6) −6.0 (−10.5 to −1.5) Not likely 29.8 (26.6–  33.0) 20.6 (14.9–  26.4) 16.8 (10.2– 23.3) 18.7 (14.3–  23.0) −11.1 (−16.5 to −5.7) Adults aged 18–  64 years with underlying medical conditions Intent to get COVID−19 vaccine Absolutely certain/ very likely**36.5 (33.4–  39.6) 44.8 (38.0–  51.5) 38.8 (32.6–  45.1) 41.8 (37.2–  46.4) 5.3 (−0.2 to 10.8) Somewhat likely 23.0 (20.3–  25.7) 19.2 (13.3– 25.0) 20.6 (14.7–  26.6) 19.9 (15.7– 24.1) −3.1 (−8.1 to 1.9) Not likely 40.4 (37.3–  43.7) 36.0 (29.4–  42.8) 40.5 (34.5–  46.5) 38.3 (33.8–  42.8) −2.1 (−7.6 to 3.4) Adults aged 18–  64 years without underlying medical conditions and nonessential workers Intent to get COVID-  19 vaccine Absolutely certain/ very likely**38.0 (34.5–  41.4) 46.3 (40.5–  52.1) 48.7 (40.0–  57.4) 47.5 (42.3–  52.7) 9.5 (3.3–  15.7) Somewhat likely 22.4 (19.4– 25.2) 18.4 (13.8–  23.1) 22.2 (13.2–  31.3) 20.3 (15.2–  25.4) −2.1 (−8.0 to 3.8) Not likely 39.8 (36.4–  43.1) 35.2 (29.5–  41.0) 29.0 (20.9– 37.2) 32.2 (27.2–  37.1) −7.6 (−13.6 to −1.6) Abbreviations: CI, confidence interval; COVID-  19, coronavirus disease 2019. *IPSOS KnowledgePanel Survey, fielded September 3–  October 1.  †IPSOS KnowledgePanel Omnibus Survey, fielded December 18–  20.  §NORC AmeriSpeak Omnibus Survey, fielded December 18–  20.  ¶CIs for differences that exclude zero are statistically significant.  **Might include some persons who already received the COVID-  19 vaccine.   16006143, 2021, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajt.16560 by Cochrane Germany, Wiley Online Library on [07/12/2023].

Second, because the sample of persons  surveyed in December was not derived from the sample of persons surveyed in September, longitudinal analysis of changes in percep - tion from the same sample of persons was not possible. Third, small sample sizes prevented separate analyses of some priority groups identified by ACIP, such as healthcare personnel, frontline and other essential workers, and adults aged 65–  74 years and ≥75  years.  Fourth, because essential worker status and high-  risk medical con - ditions were self-  reported, there might be potential for misclas - sification. Respondents were also placed into mutually exclusive  vaccine priority groups, which could not account for persons who fit within multiple groups (e.g., essential workers aged 18–  64 years  with underlying medical conditions). Fifth, attitudes and percep - tions might change quickly, and these results might not be reflective  of current reasons for not intending to receive a COVID-  19 vaccine.  Sixth, results are national estimates and cannot be generalized to  the state or local level. Finally, results might not be comparable to other national polls or surveys because of potential differences in survey methods, sample population, and questions related to vac - cination intent. Continuing to promote vaccine confidence by tailoring informa - tion to address concerns of individual persons and communities is critical to preventing the spread of COVID-  19. These findings sug - gest a decrease in nonintent over time as well as concerns about  vaccine safety among priority populations in the United States and have implications for potential messages and strategies that could boost confidence in COVID-  19 vaccines and educate essential work - ers, minority populations, and the general public about the safety  of the vaccine development process, and the known effectiveness and safety of authorized COVID-  19 vaccines. 9 Healthcare providers  are known to be a trusted source of information about vaccines for  many persons and can use CDC-  recommended guidance to have  effective conversations with patients about the need for vaccina - tion.10 Ensuring high and equitable vaccination coverage in all popu - lations is critical to preventing the spread of COVID-  19 and bringing  an end to the pandemic. ENDNOTES     *  Persons with underlying medical conditions were defined as  those who reported having any of the following conditions: cancer; chronic kidney disease; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); heart conditions (e.g., heart failure, coronary artery disease, or cardiomyopathies); immunocompromised state (weakened immune system) from solid organ transplant; obesity; pregnancy; sickle cell disease; smoking; and type 2 diabetes melli - tus. Respondents aged 18–  64 years reporting diagnosis of one or  more of these conditions were classified as high-  risk in the anal - yses. This list of underlying medical conditions does not include  Down syndrome, which was added to the list on December 23, 2020. A complete list of underlying medical conditions is avail - able at https://www.cdc.gov/coron  aviru  s/2019-  ncov/need-  extra   - preca  ution  s/peopl  e- with-  medic  al- condi  tions.html      †  Other essential workers include those who conduct a range of operations and services that are essential to continued critical infrastructure viability, including staffing operations centers, main - taining and repairing critical infrastructure, operating call centers, working construction, and performing operational functions, among others. Also included are workers who support crucial supply chains and enable functions for critical infrastructure. The industries they support represent, but are not limited to, medical and health care, telecommunications, information technology systems, defense, food and agriculture, transportation and logistics, energy, water and wastewater, and law enforcement.      §  https://www.ipsos.com/sites/  defau  lt/files/  ipsos  knowl  edgep  anel   m ethod  ology.pdf    ¶  https://www.ipsos.com/en-  us/solut  ions/publi c- affai rs/knowl  edge   p anel-  omnibus   **  https://ameri  speak.norc.org/our-  capab  iliti es/Pages/  Ameri  Speak   - Omnib  us.aspx   ††  The panels from the September and December surveys use an  address-  based sampling methodology that covers nearly all house - holds in the United States regardless of their phone or Internet  status, with a cooperation rate (proportion of all cases interviewed among all eligible units ever contacted) of 69.7% (September IPSOS survey), 38.0% (December IPSOS survey), and 22.8% (December NORC survey). Surveys were fielded in English and Spanish, and non-  Hispanic Black and non-  Hispanic other race panel members  were oversampled to ensure adequate sample size for subgroup  analyses by respondent's race/ethnicity.    §§  45 C.F.R. part 46.102(l)(2), 21 C.F.R. part 56; 42 U.S.C.

Sect. 3501 et seq.  ¶¶   Essential workers were defined as those who responded “yes” to  the following question: “In your work or volunteer activities, are you classified as an essential worker?”  *** Mutually exclusive groups were categorized in the following order:  essential workers, adults aged ≥65 years, and adults aged 18–  64 years with an underlying medical condition. Anyone who self-  identified as an essential worker was categorized as an essential worker, regardless of age. Next, anyone aged ≥65  years was catego - rized as adult aged ≥65 years. Finally, anyone aged 18–  64 years with  an underlying medical condition was categorized as adult aged 18–  64 years with an underlying medical condition. All others were cate - gorized as adults aged 18–  64 years who were not essential workers  and had no underlying medical conditions.   ††† Metropolitan statistical area (MSA) status was determined by census  block group using the panelist's address. For a small number of pan - elists for whom the address was not available, ZIP code was used to determine MSA status. https://www.census.gov/progr  ams-  surve  ys/ metro -  micro.html REFERENCES  1.
